.SH NAME
reg - region-of-interest file

.SH DESCRIPTION

A reg file contains a list of X, Y, Z coordinates which define the centers of
regular volume-of-interest in PET space (in pixels). Note that each coordinate 
start from 1 instead of 0. For a 128 x 128 slice, the center is at (64.5, 64.5).

Reg files differ from VOI files in several ways, but in particular note
that reg files have coordinates listed Z X Y!
