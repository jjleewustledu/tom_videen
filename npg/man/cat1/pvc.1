NAME
     pvc  -    apply partial volume correction to a PET image


SYNOPSIS
     pvc infile tissue mask cutoff


DESCRIPTION
     This program computes a partial volume  corrected  image  by
     dividing  the  input  file  (PET image) by a suitable tissue
     image (see imgconvol) at all points within a mask  specified
     by  the  mask  image and cutoff.  All points not in the mask
     will be zero in the output image.

     All 3 input images must be in Analyze format and the  output
     image will be in Analyze format.

     This program reads all images into working memory (for large
     images, use a workstation with suffient RAM).

     The accuracy of the resulting pvc-corrected  image  requires
     properly  coregistered  PET and tissue images.  The accuracy
     also depends critically upon the PET and tissue images being
     the  same  resolution!   See man page for gauss to determine
     the resolution of PET  images.  (And  don't  even  think  of
     applying this to Butterworth-filtered images).


EXAMPLES
     pvc ap5000ho1_g3.img rp5000tis16.img rp5000mask.img 1000

     will create pvcap5000ho1_g3.img and pvcap5000ho1_g3.hdr
