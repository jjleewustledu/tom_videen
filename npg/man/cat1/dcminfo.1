NAME
     dcminfo - extracts specified info from a DICOM image


SYNOPSIS
     dcminfo filename <s/p/a/i/r>
     dcminfo filename <ID/PAT/ACQ/IMG/REL>


DESCRIPTION
     dcminfo writes specified info from a DICOM image header.  If
     a  complete  filename  is  used,  it may have any name. If a
     number only is given as the filename, the name must be  a  5
     digit   number   followed   by  the  extension  .dcm;  i.e.,
     "00123.dcm".

          s or ID  = Study, scanner, and site information
          p or PAT = Patient information
          a or ACQ = Acquisition sequence information
          i or IMG = Image information
          r or REL = Relative slice position information

     The keys may be entered in upper or  lowercase  and  may  be
     abbreviated  by  using a single letter. DCM filenames in the
     "00123.dcm" format may be entered  as  "123"  and  both  the
     extension and preceding 0's will be added.

     This script uses the program dcm_dump_element from  the  ERL
     DICOM package.


EXAMPLES
     dcminfo 00123.dcm ID
     dcminfo 123 ACQ
