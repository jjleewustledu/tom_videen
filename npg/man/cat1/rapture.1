NAME
     rapture - Regional Analysis of Power of  T-statistics  Using
     Replication for Establishment


SYNOPSIS
     rapture _l_o_g_f_i_l_e


PARAMETERS
     _l_o_g_f_i_l_e: the logfile name. This file contains  most  of  the
     useful information you will want to save.


DESCRIPTION
     The rapture on the UNIX machines is the X window version  of
     the  rapture currently running on the Concurent machines. It
     will create and evalute 3D irregular and  spherical  regions
     of interest on 49-slice images.  Specifically:

      1) 3D ROIs may be created semi-automatically using all
         continuous voxels above (or below) a threshold value on
         some input image.

      2) Regional means may be calculated for individual and/or
         groups of images.

      3) Estimates of power for t-tests may be calculated based
         on estimates of variance from a sample input set of
         data.



DATA ANALYSIS OUTLINE
     I. Hypothesis Generation:

      1) For each foci of interest, display the slice with the
         maximum t-value.
      2) Generate an ROI and extend it to all adjacent slices.
      3) Optimize the ROI boundaries by selecting different
         threshold levels on the t-image and compute the regional
         t from the original smg files.
      4) ROI boundaries may be limited or trimmed to define an
         area of interest corresponding to hypothesis based on
         other (non-PET) information.
      5) Save the optimal ROI definition in a disk file (.trg).
      6) Process the scan list to estimate power power for
         difference numbers of subjects.
      7) Based on the power calculations, select the ROIs which
         will be pursued and the number of subjects required for
         a likely replication.

     II. Replication:

      1) Acquire a second set of control and test images.
      2) Create a new scan file list control and test files.
      3) Use rapture to compute t-values for each ROI on the new
         data sets.

     III. Presentation:

      1) Bonferroni-correct the p-values for the number of ROIs
         tested.
      2) Generate a composite t-image generated by combining the
         two lists of test and control scan files.
      3) Images may be displayed in any orientation with spideram
         (1) or view25d (1).
      4) ROIs may be outlined by using rapture (restricted to
         transverse slices) or view25d (1).
      5) Centers of mass of the ROIs are computed in rapture.


EXAMPLES OF INPUT FILES
     All input image should be 49-slice images (either PETT VI or
     ECAT 953B images).

     Input file lists may be any of the following formats.  Files
     are read in _f_i_x_e_d _f_o_r_m_a_t, so column alignment is critical!

     ROIs may be created on an unmasked image  while  restricting
     the  limits  of  the  ROIs  to that of a masking image. this
     option is intented to allow you to see  all  your  data  but
     only  define  the ROIs on data to which all subjects contri-
     buted. If you masked your image before calling rapture, this
     option  is  uncessary.  When  you select a masking file, its
     name will appear to the right of this menu option. When  you
     cancel the mask, the name should disappear.

     This masking file will also be applied to a prefined ROI  in
     any  calculations (i.e., computing mean on or t on a new set
     of data.

     S = Scale from image max

     Unlike spideram which scales the image each time you display
     it (unless you use an absolute scale), rapture always uses a
     fixed scale (saving the time required to  recompute  it  and
     allowing   you   to  force  a  scale  to  reveal  particular
     responses). Before you can display any slice data, you  must
     set  the  scale.  Normally you will select the scale for the
     slice with the maximum pixel value:

     Slice for scaling (0 to cancel)?

     Scale to positive values? <Y>

     Y --> displays positive pixel values;
     N --> displays negative pixel values;

     Image file name? <>

     A = Absolute scale

     If you wish to specify the maximum  value  for  the  display
     scale, you can do so with this option (instead of scaling to
     the maximum pixel on some particular slice).

     Scale to image max/min of? < >

     The current scale will appear in parenthesis. You may choose
     either a positive or negative scale.

     R = Region generation

     Cals up the REGION MENU (see details below).

     D = Display a region

     Displays a ROI on the specified image.

     Image file name? <>

     Outline the regions (instead of solid fill)? <N>

     There are two options: when the ROI is  displayed  on  image
     slices,  each  voxel  may be filled with solid white, or the
     entire ROI may be outlined (allowing the values of  internal
     pixels to be visualized).

     Display more slices? <Y>

     12 slices  are  displayed  at  a  time  with  the  atlas  z-
     coordinate  and slice number (in parenthesis) underneath. If
     there are more than 12 slices defining the ROI, you will get
     this prompt to display more.

     G = Get a region

     Reads an ROI from a disk file (.trg).

     Region file name? < >

     The file name may be specified with or without the extension
     (it always defaults to .trg).

     As the region file is read, a  summary  is  written  to  the
     screen.

     F = File a region

     Saves a ROI from a disk file (with extension .trg).

     Region file name? < >

     Enter the name with no extension.

     Region name? < >

     This name will be stored in the first line of the trg  file.
     The default is the file name. You may enter up to 20 charac-
     ters.

     T = Totals & stats for current region

     Gives basic statistics for the current ROI, such as:

     File on which it was defined.
     Slices on which it is defined.
     Inclusion threshold is the cutoff voxel value.
     Range gives the minimum and maximum voxel values within the ROI.
     Peak in Slice n gives the slice number of the maximum voxel.

     Stereotaxic Center of Mass in  atlas  coordinates.  This  is
     calculated using the ROI weights from the defining image. If
     you want the center of mass of a previously defined boundary
     on  a new image, you must first recompute the region weights
     (option W; see below).

     Mean voxel vlaue for the ROI.
     SD of voxel values.
     Pixels contained in ROI.

     O = Optimize region size

     This option allows you to  automatically  expand  the  boun-
     daries  of a region while computing regional t-values. It is
     intented to examine the relationship of  t  to  region  size
     and, in particular, to identify the boundaries giving a max-
     imum t. Any previously defined region is  erased  when  this
     option is caled.

     Direction of Values (-1 or +1)?

     Allows optimization of either negative or positive peaks.

     Step size for automatic region expansion?

     You may use a coarse step at first and a fine step (1)  once
     you have located the neighbourhood of the optimal threshold.

     Threshold to stop at? < >

     It this is too small, your region will become very large and
     processing  will become proportionately slower. You can stop
     processing (see below) if you are displaying the regions  as
     they are generated.

     Maximum number of pixels in region?

     The automatic enlargement of the region will stop  after  it
     has reached or exceed this size.

     Display while processing? <N>

     Display may be useful, but will slow down the  processing  a
     little.

     Proceed? <Y>

     If you enter 'N', you will return to the Main Menu; 'Y' ini-
     tialtes procesing.

     Type S to stop...

     This allows you to stop automatic  region  generation.  Note
     that  this  does not generate an interrupt; rather, the key-
     board is checked intermittently while the  region  is  being
     created.  Therefore,  the  routine  generally  not  stop  as
     promptly as you might desire. There is no harm in repetively
     strinking

     As the regions are generated, regional t is computed  and  a
     summary is written to the screen (and to the log file):

     Thresh Slices Pixels T Max T
        50       4        17    2.389   3.289        50
        45       6        29    1.389   3.289        50

     Thresh is the current threshold defining the region boundary.
     Slices and Pixels tell the size of the current region.
     T is a regional t calculated from the individual input image files.
     Max T is the maximum t computed so far and the final
     Thresh is the threshold at which Max T was found.

     ... continue? <Y>

     This prompt serves to prevent the Main Menu from  coming  up
     immediately,  scrolling the table of t-values off the screen
     before you have examined them. Simply enter RETURN after you
     have surveyed the t's and thresholds.

     The last region generated  may  be  displayed  by  selecting
     option 'D' (after continuing, of course).

     P = Process set of input

     Having defined some ROI, this option compute the regional  t
     on any list of files.

     Weight pixel values by magnitude? < >

     If you respond 'N', all pixel values within the ROI will  be
     weighted  equally  in  determining  regional  means.  It you
     respond 'Y', each pixel  values  withing  the  ROI  will  be
     weighted using the pixel magnitudes in the defining image in
     determining the regional mean. Currently there is no  proven
     superority  to weighting unequally, although there is reason
     to believe that it will be for some cases.

     The power analysis is believed to  be  useful  for  deciding
     which   ROIs  to  use  for  hypotheses.  Therefore,  as  the
     hypothesis-generation stage you should use  this,  selecting
     alpha  to  some  appropriate  value  (say  0.05  if  you are
     interested in a single region; 0.01 if you are interested in
     5 regions -- to allow for Bonferroni corrections of the test
     data).

     Also, if you want ROI information  about  mean  differences,
     probability,  etc., save in the primary log file, you should
     use a non-zero value.

     Proceed? <Y>

     It you enter 'N', you will return to the Main Menu; 'Y' ini-
     tiates processing.

     The same information is written to the screen as  in  option
     'O',  followed by a table of power (which is also written to
     the log file). An explanation of the power analysis and this
     table is given below.

     ... continue? <Y>

     This prompt serves to prevent the Main Menu from  coming  up
     immediately,  scrolling  the  table  of power off the screen
     before you have examined it. Simply enter RETURN  after  you
     have surveryed the table.

     C = Create a contiguous region

     This option automatically includes all contiguous pixels  >=
     threshold  in  a  region,  beginning  with a seed pixel. Any
     preexisting region in not erased -- hence, if  you  want  to
     create  a  _s_m_a_l_l_e_r  region, you should zero the existing one
     with option 'Z' below.

     weighted using the pixel magnitudes in the defining image in

     I = Individual image regional means

     This option allows individual regional means to be  computed
     for each image (plus individual differences for PAIRED input
     lists). It does _n_o_t compute it. The option  was  created  to
     allow  individual  means  to  be computed and later used for
     analysis in any way the user wishes  (i.e.,  ANOVA,  scatter
     plots, etc.).

     This zeros any current  ROI  definition  along  with  stored
     values  of  maximum  t's  and their thresholds. It is recom-
     mended at any time you recreate a region by dropping back to
     more restrictive thresholds.

     ROIs  may  be  restricting  to  voxels  within  some  limits
     (extending  across  all slices).  This limit is drawn in the
     REGIONS MENU.  The limits are eliminated by this command.

     Recompute region weights

     Region weights are pixel scalers initially  defined  on  the
     image  used  to  create  a  ROI. They may be used to compute
     weighted regional means (an option which appears in all com-
     putations).   They are wlays used in computing the center of
     mass of an ROI. If you want to use  scalers  different  from
     the ones in the defining image or if you wish to compute the
     center of mass of a previously defined  boundary  on  a  new
     image,  you  must first recompute the region weights for the
     new image.

        Number of pixels in any boundary limits for the regions;
        Number of pixels in the region for this slice and all
        slices;
        Slice numbers on which the region is defined.


     D = Display a slice

     A slice must be displayed before a region may be created.

     Slice? < >

     Image file name? < >

     The slice is displayed with no interpolation and zoomed by a
     factor  of  7.   The atlas z-coordinate and PET slice number
     (in parentheses) are written.

     R = Region definition

     A slice must be displayed before a region may be created.

     Use Cursor or Seed coordinates (C, S)? <S>

     If you select C, you will receive the prompt:

     Move the cursor to a point inside a region and
     press and release the left mouse button

     If you select S, you will receive two prompts for the  x,  y
     coordinates:

     X? < >

     Y? < >

     X and Y are in 128x128 array space (spideram-coordinates).

     Spherical or define by Threshold (<S, T>)? <T>

     If you select S, you will receive the prompt:

     Radius? <3>

     The current allowed radius is between 1  and  7.  After  you
     select a radius, the spherical region will be displayed.

     If you select T, regions will be defined by threshold.   You
     will receive the following prompts:

     Slice Max = 55   Pixel Max = 42

     Boundary threshold (0 to cancel)? <0>

     The threshold must be >= Pixel Max (the value  of  the  seed
     pixel), or no region will be created.

     Do you want to use values above or below this threshold?
     Direction of Values (-1 or +1)? <1>

     For positive peaks, use the default value of 1. If  you  are
     displaying  negative values and want to define a region on a
     negative peak, use -1.

     L = Limit region extent

     This option is intended to allow a region to be created  and
     optimized  on a peak which is adjacent to another peak which
     is not to be included.

     Previous limits have been eliminated.
     Make sure that the Caps Lock is OFF!

     Move the cursor to a starting point and
     press down the left most mouse button.

     Then continue holding the button to draw a line.

     When finished, release the mouse button

     You may identify pixels which will not be  included  in  the
     region.   Since regions must be contiguous pixels, the pix-
     els you draw set a boundary or limit on  any  region.   This
     boundary extends through all slices.

     Once created, these limits may be eliminated by zeroing  the
     limits with option 'L' in the Main Menu.

     E = Extent of limits displayed

     This option displays any existing limits (created by  option
     'L') on the currently displayed slice.

     T = Trim pixels

     This option allows you to selectively remove individual pix-
     els  from  a  region.  You will get the following prompts if
     you press T or t.

     Make sure that the Caps Lock is OFF!

     Move the cursor to a starting point and press down the  left
     most mouse button.

     Then continue holding the button  to  define  points  to  be
     erased.

     When finished, release the mouse button.

     Z = Zero region for this slice

     Eliminates all voxels in the ROI on the currently  displayed
     slice and erases them from the display.


     O = Outline

     Changes the displayed ROI so that only the boundary  outline
     appears, thus allowing the internal voxel values to be visu-
     alized.

     C = Current region display

     Displays ROI on currently displayed slice.

     N = Next slice

     This option allows you to automatically extend the region to
     an  adjacent  slice identifying all contiguous voxels >= the
     same threshold or the voxels that lie inside  a  3D  sphere.
     The  comparison  slice  is  automatically incremented in one
     direction.

     You can achieve the same result over  all  slices  by  using
     options  in  the  Main Menu. The utility of this particular
     option is in allowing you to restrict the region to particu-
     lar slices.

     Comparison slice? < >

     The comparison slice must be one on  which  regional  pixels
     have been defined.

     New slice for defining region? < >

     Must be adjacent to the comparison slice  (i.e.,  differ  by
     +/- 1).

     M = Main menu

     Returns to the Main Menu.

     Interpretation of Power Analysis Table:

        A power analysis estimates the probability  of  rejecting
     the  null  hypothesis  when  it  is  false.  Power therefore

     depends on the following:

        1)  alpha  -  the  probability  of  rejecting  the   null
     hypothesis  when  it is true (also referred to as the proba-
     bility of a Type I error).

        2) population variance or standard deviation, SD

        3) sample size, n

        4) an estimate of the actual mean difference in the popu-
     lation, D

        In practice, alpha is  set  arbitrarily  (customarily  to
     0.05  for  testing single differences).  Population variance
     must be estimated from a sample.  A number of different sam-
     ple sizes may be tested for power.  The estimate of the true
     difference depends on what is observed in a sample plus what
     one is willing to accept as physiologically significant.

        The implementation of the estimate of power in rapture is
     based  on  the  algorithm  in  W.L.  Hays, Statistics in the
     Social Sciences, 1973, p 411.  One picks  values  for  alpha
     and n, estimates SD and D from a sample set, computes a non-
     centrality parameter, then uses Scheffe's (1959)  approxima-
     tion  to  the  noncentral  t  distribution  to compute beta.
     Power = 1-beta.

        For unpaired t-tests, a non-pooled estimate  of  variance
     is  used  as  well as a correction to the degrees of freedom
     for samples of different sizes.

        Use of the t test involves two assumptions:  1) the  sam-
     ple  populations are normal, and 2) the population variances
     are homogeneous (for unpaired t's).  T tests are robust with
     respect  to  the  first  assumption  if sample sizes are not
     extremely small.  They are also more sensitive to violations
     for  one-tailed  tests.   The second assumption is also less
     important if large  sample  sizes  (and  equal  samples  for
     unpaired data) are used.

        The table of power computed by rapture (example below) is
     read  as  follows.   To create the table the user has picked
     alpha = .005 (not the column labeled p).   The  variance  is
     based  on  the  current  data  sample (SD= 26.5474).  Sample
     sizes of N=2-20 are listed in  rows.   Five  different  cri-
     terion  true  differences are listed in columns (the percen-
     tages represent regional  changes  with  respect  to  global
     blood  flow).  For each postulated difference, there are two
     columns:  the first gives power for 1-tailed tests  and  the
     second  for 2-tailed tests.  For most hypothesis testing you
     would use a 1-tailed test (where the sign of the  change  is

        The accuracy of this table depends  on  the  estimate  of
     variance, and will suffer accordingly for small initial sam-
     ples.

PECULIARITIES
     If the frame duration in a Version 6 ECAT image file  is  0,
     rapture  will  give  DIFFERENT  mean  values  from all other
     software (I believe by a factor of 10).  This is due to  the
     differences  in  the  way  2 image libraries interpret these
     files (typically a frame duration of 0 indicates a transmis-
     sion image).
