TBYTES(1)                 User Commands                 TBYTES(1)



NAME
     tbytes - total bytes in an tape archive listing.


SYNOPSIS
     tbytes <filename>


DESCRIPTION
     This script reads a "tarchive" report file, searches for all
     lines containing the word "Archived", and computes a running
     sum of the bytes in those files.  The total in Megabytes  is
     written  along with an estimate of how much space is left on
     the tape.  This estimate assumes that the  8505  tape  drive
     will hold approximately 10 GB of data.

     The total bytes  is  only  accurate  for  files  which  were
     created  using  the  output of arcverify (or tarchive, which
     calls arcverify).


EXAMPLE
     tbytes patient70
