     anahdr - dump contents of an Analyze hdr

SYNOPSIS
     anahdr filename


DESCRIPTION
     Anahdr reads an Analyze header and writes  the  contents  of
     all fields.

     Most fields are self explanatory. Datatypes are:
           0   = unknown
           1   =  1 bit/pixel
           2   =  8 bits/pixel
           4   = 16 bits/pixel (short int)
           8   = 32 bits/pixel (signed int)
          16   = 32 bits/pixel (float)
          32   = 64 bits/pixel (2 floats)
          64   = 64 bits/pixel (double)
