     The following procedure will segment a CT image to  a  brain
     tissue  image  suitable for partial volume correction of PET
     images.  I have listed both the full syntax for each command
     as  well  as  shortcuts  using C shell variables. The syntax
     statement always precedes  the  shell  shortcut  and  syntax
     lines begin with '%'.

        set PID = p5000

     1) Convert to Hounsfield units: (vidi) (p5000ct_n)
          a) Check all planes; If not in Hounsfield units, convert and reload:
               % anasub filename subtrahend
                 anasub ${PID}ct_n 1020

     3) Edit p5000ct_n.img: (vidi) (p5000ct_n -> p5000seg1)
          1) Locate pineal calcification and replace with brain intensity:
               (Max=100; Fill=60; Replace Only If >= 60)
          b) Using vidi, fill ventricular calcification & choroid plexus (Max=50; Fill=18).
             (brain_min(10) <= 18 <= brain/csf(20) both before and after normalization)
             It can speed some of the later steps if the eyes are removed now (Fill=-2000).
          c) Pick a pixel within the brain (for segment_ct1 and segment_ct2).
               set BRAIN = '250 250 10'
          d) Save edited image as p5000seg1.img

     3) Auto-segmentation to isolate brain from bone: (p5000seg1 -> p5000seg2)
          % segment_ct1 pid x_brain y_brain z_brain
            segment_ct1 $PID $BRAIN
            (e.g., segment_ct1 p5000 250 250 10)

     4) Edit p5000seg2.img: (vidi) (p5000seg2 -> p5000seg3)
          a) Isolate brainstem if there is connecting tissue (Fill=-2000).
          b) Sever optic nerve to isolate the eyeballs (Fill=-2000).
          c) Locate approximate plane of anterior commissure (z_ac).
               set ZAC = 32
          d) Save as p5000seg3.img

     5) Auto-segmentation to isolate brain: (p5000seg3 -> p5000seg4)
          % segment_ct2 pid x_brain y_brain z_brain z_ac
            segment_ct2 $PID $BRAIN $ZAC
            (e.g., segment_ct2 p5000 250 250 10 32)

     6) Edit p5000seg4.img: (vidi) (p5000seg4 -> p5000brain_n)
          a) Remove any remaining external tissue.
          b) Save as p5000brain_n.img
               % if2analyze filename
                 if2analyze ${PID}brain_n

     7) Edit p5000brain_n.img: (vidi) (p5000brain_n -> p5000vent_n)
          a) Identify point(s) in ventricles (unlimited number permitted)
               set BRAIN_CSF = 20
               set VENT1 = '240 260 19'
               set VENT2 = '191 248 35'

User Commands                                  CT_SEGMENTATION(1)



               set VENT3 = '264 299 31'
               % maskout in out absmin brain_thresh setval $VENT1 $VENT2 $VENT3
                 maskout ${PID}brain_n ${PID}seg_vent -100 $BRAIN_CSF -2000 $VENT1 $VENT2 $VENT3
          b) Check p5000seg_vent.img (Max=1) (still using p5000ct_n.img as a reference)
          c) Repeat (a)-(b) adding points until all ventricles are included.
          d) Set all pixels in ventricles to 1 and all others to 0.
               % maskand in out absmin brain_thresh setval
                 maskand ${PID}seg_vent ${PID}seg_vent -100 $BRAIN_CSF 1
               % maskand in out absmin 0 0
                 maskand ${PID}seg_vent ${PID}seg_vent -2000 0 0
          e) Cleanup ventricles (Fill=0) removing:
               choroidal fissure
               quadrigeminal cistern
               ambient cistern
               interpeduncular fossa
          f) Save as p5000vent_n.img

     8) For ICH patients: Load p5000brain_n.img (vidi) (p5000brain_n -> p5000clot_n)
          a) Trace VOIs for 'clot' and 'brain' VOI in tissue surrounding clot.
          b) Write VOIs to p5000brain.voi
          c) Determine threshold for clot segmentation using:
               % voihistos imagefile voifile
                 voihistos ${PID}brain_n.img ${PID}brain.voi
                 set BRAIN_CLOT = 60
          d) Identify pixel(s) in clot and segment it:
                 set CLOT  = '310 280 23'
                 set CLOT2 = '310 280 23'
               % maskout in out clot_thresh maxval setval x1 y1 z1 [x2 y2 z2]
                 maskout ${PID}brain_n ${PID}seg_clot $BRAIN_CLOT 500 0 $CLOT $CLOT2
          e) Load p5000clot_n.img (still using p5000ct_n.img as a reference)
          f) Repeat (d)-(e) until all of clot is included.
          g) Cleanup clot if necessary.
          h) Save as p5000clot_n.img

     9) Auto-segmentation to define final tissue boundaries: (p5000brain_n -> p5000tis_n)
          % segment_ct3 pid brain_n vent_n tis_n clot_n
            segment_ct3 $PID brain_n vent_n tis_n clot_n
            (e.g., segment_ct3 p5000 brain_n vent_n tis_n clot_n)

     10) View p5000tis_n.img (Max=2, %Cutoff=1, PET Rainbow)
        superimposed on p5000ct_n.img (Max~60, Linear Gray)
          a) Check for accurate segmentation on all slices.
          b) Use Fill=0 to remove tissue.
          c) Use Fill=1 to add tissue (Replace Only If = 0).
             Pixels which may have been removed which should be filled
             include edema and old infarcts.
             (Ventricles and clot should have values of -1 in this image).
          d) Save as p5000tis_n.img
