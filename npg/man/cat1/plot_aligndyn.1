NAME
     plot_aligndyn - plot log files created by aligndyn


SYNOPSIS
     plot_aligndyn


DESCRIPTION
     This is an IDL program which plots the mean pixel  misalign-
     ment as estimated by aligndyn.  It plots mm displacement vs.
     frame number for the Mean and X, Y and Z displacements.

     Call the program with "plot_aligndyn".  At the prompt
          Alignment log filename:

     enter the full name of the file, i.e., p2788mb_th3_g3.log.

     at the prompt:
          First (reference) frame:

     enter the number of the first frame specified  when  running
     aligndyn.   Entering  an  incorrect number will merely shift
     the curve on the x-axis.

     The program computes the maximum and  minimum  mean  shifts,
     which it displays as:
          First (reference) frame: 3
                2.63100     -1.63700
          Maximum for plot:

     At this prompt you can pick the range for  the  y  axes  (in
     this case, 4 would be an appropriate response).

     At the prompt:
          print, continue or exit [p,c,x]:

     Typing 'p' will send  a  postscript  file  to  your  default
     printer  (lpr, which should be a postscript printer). Typing
     'c' will permit plotting a different file or the  same  file
     using a different range. Typing 'x' exits the program.

     The program requires a runtime IDL license.
