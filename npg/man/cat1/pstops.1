NAME
     pstops - shuffle pages in a PostScript file

SYNOPSIS
     pstops [ -q ] [ -b ] [ -w_w_i_d_t_h ] [ -h_h_e_i_g_h_t ] [ -p_p_a_p_e_r ]  [
     -d_l_w_i_d_t_h ] _p_a_g_e_s_p_e_c_s [ _i_n_f_i_l_e [ _o_u_t_f_i_l_e ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_s_t_o_p_s rearranges pages from a PostScript document, creating
     a  new  PostScript  file.   The input PostScript file should
     follow the Adobe Document Structuring  Conventions.   _P_s_t_o_p_s
     can  be  used  to  perform  a  large number of arbitrary re-
     arrangements of Documents, including arranging for  printing
     2-up,  4-up,  booklets,  reversing,  selecting front or back
     sides of documents, scaling, etc.

     _p_a_g_e_s_p_e_c_s follow the syntax:

          _p_a_g_e_s_p_e_c_s   = [_m_o_d_u_l_o:]_s_p_e_c_s

          _s_p_e_c_s       = _s_p_e_c[+_s_p_e_c_s][,_s_p_e_c_s]

          _s_p_e_c        = [-]_p_a_g_e_n_o[_L][_R][_U][@_s_c_a_l_e][(_x_o_f_f,_y_o_f_f)]

     _m_o_d_u_l_o is the number of pages in each block.  The  value  of
     _m_o_d_u_l_o  should  be  greater  than 0; the default value is 1.
     _s_p_e_c_s are the page specifications  for  the  pages  in  each
     block.  The  value  of  the  _p_a_g_e_n_o  in  each _s_p_e_c should be
     between 0 (for the first page in  the  block)  and  _m_o_d_u_l_o-1
     (for  the  last page in each block) inclusive.  The optional
     dimensions _x_o_f_f and _y_o_f_f shift the  page  by  the  specified
     amount.   _x_o_f_f  and _y_o_f_f are in PostScript's points, but may
     be followed by the units cm or in to convert to  centimetres
     or  inches,  or  the flag w or h to specify as a multiple of
     the width or height.  The optional parameters _L,  _R,  and  _U
     rotate  the  page left, right, or upside-down.  The optional
     _s_c_a_l_e parameter scales the page by the  fraction  specified.
     If  the  optional minus sign is specified, the page is rela-
     tive to the end of the document, instead of the start.

     If page _s_p_e_cs are separated by + the pages  will  be  merged
     into  one  page;  if they are separated by , they will be on
     separate pages.  If there is only  one  page  specification,
     with _p_a_g_e_n_o zero, the _p_a_g_e_n_o may be omitted.

     The shift, rotation, and scaling are performed in that order
     regardless of which order they appear on the command line.

     The -_w option gives the width which is used by the w  dimen-
     sion  specifier, and the -_h option gives the height which is
     used by the h dimension specifier. These dimensions are also
     used (after scaling) to set the clipping path for each page.

     The -_p option can be used as  an  alternative,  to  set  the
     paper  size  to a3, a4, a5, b5, letter, legal, or 10x14. The
     default paper size is a4.

     The -_b option prevents any bind operators in the  PostScript
     prolog  from binding. This may be needed in cases where com-
     plex multi-page re-arrangements are being done.

     The -_d option draws a line around the border of  each  page,
     of the specified width.  If the _l_w_i_d_t_h parameter is omitted,
     a default linewidth of 1 point is assumed. The linewidth  is
     relative  to the original page dimensions, _i._e. it is scaled
     up or down with the rest of the page.

     Pstops normally prints the page numbers  of  the  pages  re-
     arranged; the -_q option suppresses this.

EXAMPLES
     This section contains some sample  re-arrangements.  To  put
     two  pages  on  one sheet (of A4 paper), the pagespec to use
     is:

                 2:0L@.7(21cm,0)+1L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)

     To select all of the odd pages in reverse order, use:

                                 2:-0

     To re-arrange pages for printing 2-up booklets, use

                 4:-3L@.7(21cm,0)+0L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)

     for the front sides, and

                 4:1L@.7(21cm,0)+-2L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)

     for the reverse sides (or join them with a comma for  duplex
     printing).
