NAME
     setanamin - sets global min and max in an ANALYZE hdr


SYNOPSIS
     setanamin ANALYZE_root minimum [maximum]


DESCRIPTION
     setanamin is useful for forcing the  global  minimum  in  an
     Analyze  image  to  0,  thus avoiding a "feature" in the AIR
     package which automatically scales 16-bit data  to  unsigned
     integers.   The  processing  is  usually  not  what you wish
     unless the negative values are zeroed first.

     Likewise, is it useful for restoring the global  minimum  in
     the  header  prior  to  running reslice16, which shifts 0 to
     -32768 with 16-bit data if the input minimum is not < 0.

     You may also set the maximum  in  the  header.  The  maximum
     influences the behavior of some programs, notably Image Edit
     within Analyze and alignlinear.

     Note that setanamin does NOT change the values in the image,
     but  only  in  the hdr file.  This is sufficient for AIR and
     preserves the data for other programs.


EXAMPLES
     setanamin p2000ho1 0
     setanamin p2000ho1 -115
     setanamin p2000ho1 0 1000
