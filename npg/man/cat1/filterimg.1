NAME
     filterimg - filters all images in an imagelist


SYNOPSIS
     filterimg prm lst


DESCRIPTION
     This program checks all images in an imagelist.  If  a  fil-
     tered  image does not exist, it will be created in the local
     directory using either gauss or butterworth filters.  If  an
     image  cannot  be  found  or created, the program prints and
     ERROR message and continues processing the rest of the list.

     The program may be used to check the existence of all  files
     in  a  list.  For example, if the parameter _i_m_g_f_i_l_t_e_r is not
     defined in the prm list or set to the reconstruction filter,
     the  program  will search for all the unfiltered images.  In
     this sense, it is a substitute for chklist  except  that  it
     does  not  look  for sxr files.  This option may be used for
     PETT VI images, for which additional  filters  are  unneces-
     sary.

     The program will search in the datapath  (if  defined),  the
     local  directory,  and  the archive for image files (in this
     order). The execution is significantly faster when  checking
     a list of existing filtered images.


SAMPLE PARAMETER FILE
     The following parameters are recognized by filterimg:

     datapath:
     species:        p
     tracer:         ho
     extension:      img                         #v
     scanner:        953                         #961, pett6
     acquisition:    3d                          #wobble, stationary, low_resolution (etc)
     reconstruction: 3d_filtered_backprojection  #filtered_backprojection (etc)
     recfilter:      ramp                        #filterg (etc)
     imglist_mode:   standard
     imgfilter:      butterworth 0.5 5           #gauss 0.2 (etc)

     Note that all text appearing after a  "#"  on  any  line  is
     ignored.   Hence,  a  quick  way to check for the unfiltered
     images is to insert a # before imgfilter.  Options for  key-
     words  may be found in the man page for prm, but some common
     ones are listed above.
