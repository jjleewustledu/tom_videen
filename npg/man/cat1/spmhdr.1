     spmhdr filename


DESCRIPTION
     Spmhdr reads an SPM header and writes the  contents  of  all

     Most fields are self explanatory. Datatypes are:
           0   = unknown
           1   =  1 bit/pixel
           2   =  8 bits/pixel
           4   = 16 bits/pixel (short int)
           8   = 32 bits/pixel (signed int)
          16   = 32 bits/pixel (float)
          32   = 64 bits/pixel (2 floats)
          64   = 64 bits/pixel (double)
