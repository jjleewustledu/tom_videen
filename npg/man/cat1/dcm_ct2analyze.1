NAME
     dcm_ct2analyze - Converts CT images from  DICOM  to  Analyze
     and Interfile format (img, hdr, and ifh files).


SYNOPSIS
     dcm_ct2analyze <first> <last> <output_root> [-n] [-debug]

     Using "-n" will turn off correction for gantry  tilt.   (Use
     this for segmentation for partial volume correction).


DESCRIPTION
     dcm_ct2analyze reads multiple, sequential CT image files  in
     DICOM  format, reorients them to the 3D ordering expected by
     Analyze and writes a single image file comprising all slices
     plus  an  Analyze header file (.hdr) and an Interfile Format
     header file (.ifh).  It  does  not  change  the  input  data
     except for reorientation; specifically, it does not generate
     voxels with uniform, cubic dimensions.

     Input DICOM files must be named with a 5 digit  number  fol-
     lowed  by the extension .dcm; i.e., "00001.dcm". The program
     "dcm_rename" converts Siemens DICOM filenames to names  with
     this format.

     The Analyze orientation will match  labels  within  Analyze.
     Note  that  Analyze  thinks  in radiological orientation and
     displays right-on-left (viewing the body from the feet).

     Use dcm_ctheader to determine the appropriate file numbers.


NOTE
     Use dcm2analyze for MR DICOM files!


EXAMPLES
     dcm_ct2analyze 2 47 p2134 -n     # no correction for gantry tilt
     dcm_ct2analyze 3 3 p4567         # correction for gantry tilt
