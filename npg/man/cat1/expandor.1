NAME
     expandor - set to spec. value all pixels <= min  OR  >=  max
     AND which are connected to a pixel with another spec. value


SYNOPSIS
     expandor input output oldval newval min max


PARAMETERS
     input  - filename of input image
     output - filename of output image
     oldval - value to identify previously masked pixels
     newval - value to assign to masked pixels
     min    - mask below this intensity
     max    - mask above this intensity


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads an ANALYZE image and sets  the  value  of
     all  pixels  which  have  values either <= min OR >= max and
     which are connected to  a  pixel  having  another  specified
     value. All other pixel values will be preserved.

     The search  for  connected  pixels  is  done  plane-by-plane
     without searching for connected pixels in adjacent planes.

     This masked object image is written to the  output  file  in
     ANALYZE format.


EXAMPLE
     expandor p5000ct_n p5000seg1_n -1000 -1000 20 50
