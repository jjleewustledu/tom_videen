PROCEDURE
     The following programs may be used to  transform  MR  images
     into  Talairach 1988 space using t88trans.  This example has
     all steps for one example image.


MR image in Analyze format
     The following assumes that p5133mr0.img  has  been  oriented
     such that one plane includes the anterior and posterior com-
     missures (Talairach z-origin).

     p5133mr0.img - Analyze image (160x256x256) - Original
     p5133mr0.hdr - Analyze header

     p5133mr1.img - Analyze image (80x128x128) - resized to 2mm pixels
     p5133mr1.hdr - Analyze header

     p5133mr2.img - Analyze image (128x128x128) - padded to 128x128
     p5133mr2.hdr - Analyze header


FILE lst
     5133  2  0.0  mr.map

     Note: If you do not wish to run imgmean on your  MR  images,
     set  the normalization to the same value in both the imagel-
     ist and prm file (i.e., use 1.0 in the lst  instead  of  0.0
     and  set  smg_norm to 1).  Should you wish to normalized the
     MR images (a good idea), the lst and prm  files  shown  here
     will  work. However, you _m_u_s_t _r_e_m_o_v_e the peak slice from the
     sxr files.  Make a local copy of the sxr  files  and  change
     the  last to values of the 4th line to zeros.  When your run
     imgmean you should see "Peak from slices: 1 - 128".  If  you
     do not see a range of slices, your sxr file has a peak slice
     defined in it.  (Should this procedure be used on a  regular
     basis, I will remove this behavior from imgmean).

MR EXAMPLE
     analyze
          Load p5133mr0 resized (interpolate, cubic voxels, 2.0 mm voxels)
          Save as p5133mr1
     analyze2img p5133mr1 p5133mr2.v
     img2analyze p5133mr2.v p5133mr2
     analyze
          Load p5133mr2 and check the origin (anterior commissure)
               and brain dimensions (using Display Oblique)
          Note: the dimensions should be 1/2 of those in the original,
               y and z coordinates should be 1/2 (i.e., y' = 0.5*y), and
               x coordinate should be (0.5 * x') + 24.0
          Also, whereas Analyze will not show fractional values,
               makemap can handle them.

     alignlinear p5133mr2 p5133mr2 p5133mr.air -m 6
     scanair p5133mr.air
          (should show an identity matrix)
     makemap p5133mr.map p5133mr.air 66 71 74 64 84 34
          (your coordinates will differ!)
     imgmean prm lst
     t88trans prm lst p5133mr.t88
     cv7to6 p5133mr.t88 p5133mr_6.t88 1


NOTES
     All of the above steps may be performed on either Sun  4.1.3
     or Solaris 2 and all ECAT format images (including MR's) may
     be view with spideram  on  either  OS.   Currently,  view25d
     requires Version 6 ECAT files and runs only under Sun 4.1.3.
     Also, mri2analyze runs only on Sun 4.1.3.

     analyze2img clips or pads slices to create an  output  image
     with  128x128  pixel  slices.  If  it  removes brain pixels,
     resize the pixels in Analyze first.

     MR images in ECAT format may  be  summed  with  t88trans  or
     imean.

     The following warning often means that t1 and/or t2 are  too
     large  in  alignlinear  (but  does  not mean that the fit is
     wrong; examine it!)

          WARNING, HESSIAN MATRIX IS NOT POSITIVE DEFINITE
          FUNCTION MAY BE NEAR INFLECTION POINT OR MAXIMUM
          USE RESULTS WITH CAUTION

     The following warning is a good bet that the fit is erroneous.

          WARNING: matposd(): Singular matrix from routine rg()

CHECKING THE FIT
     The program vidi may  be  used  to  check  the  registration
     between the PET and MR.  IMHO this is faster and more versa-
     tile than  the  ANALYZE.   Alternatively,  use  the  Surface
     Matching process in ANALYZE and select the two images as the
     base and match volumes in the Transform option.

     In either case, while the MR image of the brain only is used
     by  alignlinear,  the  MR  image  of the entire head is more
     illuminating when comparing PET to MR registration.


COMPARING WITH PET
     If you wish to use exactly the same transformation for  your
     MR images as for your PET images, use a 128x128 MR image for
     your PET to MR registration.   The  following  assumes  that
     p5133mr2.img is an eroded brain image with one plane includ-
     ing the anterior and posterior commissures.
