NAME
     sumlateral - creates a lateral projection of an image

SYNOPSIS
     sumlateral infile outfile [min max]


DESCRIPTION
     Sumlateral adds all sagittal planes of an image and  creates
     a  single-plane  image.  The  central plane is marked with a
     short line at each end using the  maximum  pixel  intensity.
     The  threshold  and  limit may be used to limit the range of
     values which will are summed in the projection.

     This program may be used to create a lateral projection of a
     transmission  image  to  compare with the lateral x-ray.  In
     this case, limits of 1100 and 1250 work reasonably well.

     PETT VI and ECAT image (versions 6 &  7)  file  formats  are
     supported.


EXAMPLE
     sumlateral p5000tr1.v p5000tr1lat.v 1100 1250
