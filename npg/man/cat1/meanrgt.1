NAME
     meanrgt - creates composite  rgt  files  for  JSP  parameter
     estimation


SYNOPSIS
     meanrgt <pid> <tracer>


DESCRIPTION
     This reads multiple reg and rgt files plus a time curve  and
     creates  output  files  for Joel's parameter estimation rou-
     tine.


INPUT FILES
     For pid=p2930 and tracer=fd, the following files must exist:

     For each plane on which the ROIs were created, there  should
     be 3 files:
          <pid><tracer><plane>.reg
          <pid><tracer><plane>a.rgt
          <pid><tracer><plane>b.rgt

     where the "a" and "b" rgt files correspond to the  first  20
     frames  and  the  last 1-20 frames (21 to 40 time frames are
     allowed).

     All ROIs are assumed to be the same size  in  computing  the
     mean regional activity.

     The ROIs must have names that contain the following strings.
         caud_l
         caud_r
         putant_l
         putant_r
         putpost_l
         putpost_r
         occip
         cblm

     All reg and rgt files must contain all of the  first  6  ROI
     names.  The ROI names may appear in any order.

     The occip and cblm ROIs must exist in exactly  one  reg  and
     one rgt file.

     There must be a time data file named:
          <pid><tracer>tim.dat

     For example (for ROIs on 4 planes):
          rmp2930fd15.reg

          rmp2930fd18a.rgt
          rmp2930fd18b.rgt
          rmp2930fdtim.dat


OUTPUT FILES
     Four files  are  created.  Three  prm  files  contain  time-
     activity  data  for  the cerebellum, occipital cortex, and 8
     striatal ROIs, respectively.

          rmp2930cblm.prm
          rmp2930occip.prm
          rmp2930striatal.prm

     A dat file will contain exactly 4 lines:
          1) first and last time frames to be used in the fit
          2) name of the time file
          3) name of the file containing background (occip)
          4) name of file containing striatal activity

          rmp2930striatal.dat

     This may be edited to change the frame numbers or to use the
     cerebellum as the background region.
