NAME
     gauss2d - filters images using a 2D Gaussian filter


SYNOPSIS
     gauss2d infile [outfile] half_freq


DESCRIPTION
     gauss2d filters images in ECAT version 6 or 7, PETT  VI,  or
     Interfile formats using a Gaussian filter with the specified
     half-frequency in 2 dimensions only.  For the filtered image
     to be interpretable, the input image should have been recon-
     structed with a ramp filter with cutoff at the Nyquist  fre-
     quency.

     The output filename is optional; if not specified, a  common
     default name is created.  A recfile will be created.


PARAMETERS
     infile    - input image filename
     outfile   - output filename (optional)
     half_freq - half frequency (cycles/cm)


RESOLUTION OF FILTERED IMAGES
     See man page for gauss. Resolution in the  z-dimension  will
     be that of the scanner.


EXAMPLES
     gauss2d p2000ho1.img 0.3
     gauss2d p2000ho1.img p2000ho1_2dg3.img 0.3
