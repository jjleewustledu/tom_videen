NAME
     cv7topett6 - convert ECAT Version 7 images to PETT VI  image
     format


SYNOPSIS
     cv7topett6 infile frame [outfile]


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads 1 frame from a version 7 ECAT image  file
     and writes a PETT VI image file. It thereby permits compati-
     bility with old programs which only read this format.

     Filenames should be  specified  _w_i_t_h_o_u_t  extensions  (.v  is
     assumed  for the input and .img for the output).  If no out-
     put filename is specified, it will have the same  root  name
     as the input file.

     Note that the binary will convert version 6 ECAT  files  but
     the current script is written for version 7 files


EXAMPLES
     cv7topett6 p5000ho1 2
     cv7topett6 p5000cg1 10 p5000cg10
