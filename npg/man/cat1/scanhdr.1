SCANHDR(1)                User Commands                SCANHDR(1)



NAME
     scanhdr - read the header of any ECAT file and write a  sum-
     mary of information

SYNOPSIS
     scanhdr filename


DESCRIPTION
     Scanhdr reads the main header of any ECAT file and writes  a
     summary.   As it only reads the main header, it can read all
     ECAT files including emission, transmission, blank, and nor-
     malization files. (ecathdr works only with image files).

     The information displayed includes:   scan  date,  filetype,
     data  type, acquisition type, wobble/stationary acquisition,
     isotope, frames, planes, and horizontal bed position.

     File types:
          1 = sinogram
          2 = image
          3 = attenuation
          4 = normalization
          5 = smo

     Data types:
          2 = I*2 VAX
          3 = I*4 VAX
          4 = R*4 VAX
          5 = R*4 Sun
          6 = I*2 Sun
          7 = I*4 Sun

     Acquisition types:
          0 = blank or normalization
          2 = transmission
          3 = emission

     If you attempt to run scanhdr on a non-ECAT file,  you  will
     get a core dump :-(

          Segmentation fault (core dumped)
