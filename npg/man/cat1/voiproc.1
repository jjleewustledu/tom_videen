NAME
     voiproc - compute mean regional activity  for  3-D  volumes-
     of-interest on dynamic images


SYNOPSIS
     voiproc prm lst voi timefile

     prm = parameter file (see man prm(5))
     lst = imagelist file (see man imagelist(5))
     voi = volume-of-interest or region file (see man voi(5)
     timefile = original dynamic image from which times are read


DESCRIPTION
     voiproc computes the mean regional activity for  volumes-of-
     interest  (VOI)  for  all images in an image list and writes
     the output to separate rgt files for each VOI.

     Note: reg files are in the format  output  by  spideram  and
     must  begin  with  the number 20. Voi files have a different
     format and must begin with the number 30 (see man reg(5)  or
     voi(5) for examples).

     A single hdr file generated by petproc on the first image or
     image  frame is required.  Images may be processed as decay-
     corrected or uncorrected tissue activity.

     Note that voiproc will compute wellcounts/ml/sec.   This  is
     the  same  units  as  in  spideram  but differs from voistat
     (which computes wellcounts/ml/frame).

     Images which should be processed as cbf, cbv, oef  or  cmro2
     cannot be processed with voiproc--use voistat!


DEFINING A VOI
     VOI size and shape are defined by the  parameter  _v_o_i.  VOIs
     never  use fractional voxels or interpolated values. For all
     VOIs, image voxels are either entirely included or excluded.
     The  centers,  which  may  be  real numbers or integers, are
     defined in the region files and the shape and dimensions are
     defined  in the parameter file.  VOI size is constant and an
     integral number of voxels -- the center may be moved  up  to
     1/2 pixel.

     For a spherical VOI, a voxel is  included  if  the  distance
     between  its center and the VOI center is <= 0.5 * diameter.
     If diameter = 0, the VOI will be exactly 1 voxel.

     For a cubic VOI, a voxel is included if the distance between
     its  center  and the center of the VOI is <= 0.5 * dimension

     for all three dimensions of the cube.


STANDARD VOXEL SIZES
     Our PET images _u_s_u_a_l_l_y have the following dimensions:

         Image Type  Voxel Width & Height   Voxel Depth
         ----------  --------------------   -----------
         ECAT 961        2.086 mm            3.125 mm
         ECAT 953B       2.086 mm            3.375 mm
         PETT VI         2.86  mm           14.4   mm
         t88mean         2.00  mm            2.0   mm
         t88trans        2.00  mm            2.0   mm

     ECAT voxel width and height depend on the zoom  factor  used
     during reconstruction. Use imghdr to check.


EXAMPLE VOIs for ECAT 961:
     voi:  cube 10.5 10.5 1      # 5x5 pixels x 1 plane (25 voxels)
     voi:  cube 10.5 10.5 15.6   # 5x5 pixels x 5 planes (125 voxels)
     voi:  sphere 10.4           # 1.1 cc sphere (81 voxels)
     voi:  cylinder 75.0 146.8   # 15 cm circle across 47 planes


EXAMPLE VOIs for ECAT 953B:
     voi:  cube 10.5 10.5 1      # 5x5 pixels x 1 plane (25 voxels)
     voi:  cube 10.5 10.5 16.8   # 5x5 pixels x 5 planes (125 voxels)
     voi:  sphere 10.4           # 1.2 cc sphere (81 voxels)
     voi:  cylinder 75.0 104.6   # 15 cm circle across 31 planes


EXAMPLE VOIs for PETT VI:
     voi:  cube 14.3 14.3 1      # 5x5 pixels x 1 plane (25 voxels)
     voi:  cube 14.3 14.3 43.6   # 5x5 pixels x 3 planes (25 voxels)
     voi:  cylinder 75.0 100.0   # 15 cm circle across 7 planes


OUTPUT
     The actual volume in cc and the total number  of  voxels  it
     contains  are written to the rgtfile.  If _a_n_y voxel of a VOI
     falls outside the image, the VOI mean  will  be  written  as
     -99999.0.
