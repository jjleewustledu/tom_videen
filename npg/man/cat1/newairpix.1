NAME
     newairpix - changes pixel sizes in an air file


SYNOPSIS
     newairpix fname std_size res_size


DESCRIPTION
     This program changes the values of the pixel sizes  for  the
     standard  and  reslice  images  in an air file.  Some of our
     realignment procedures use a resampling matrix (stored in an
     air  file)  which was created from a standard image.  Due to
     slight differences in reconstruction programs,  image  pixel
     sizes occasionally differ by small amounts (< 1%).  However,
     AIR will not reslice an image if pixel sizes differ.

     Since the resampling matrices  can  be  used  regardless  of
     these small differences, newairpix was created to change the
     values in the AIR file to circumvent this prohibition.
