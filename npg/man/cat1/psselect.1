NAME
     psselect - select pages from a PostScript file

SYNOPSIS
     psselect [ -q ] [ -e ] [ -o ] [ -r ] [ -p_p_a_g_e_s ] [ _p_a_g_e_s ] [
     _i_n_f_i_l_e [ _o_u_t_f_i_l_e ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_s_s_e_l_e_c_t selects pages from a PostScript document,  creating
     a new PostScript file. The input PostScript file should fol-
     low the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions.

     The -_e option selects all of the even pages; it may be  used
     in  conjunction  with  the  other  page selection options to
     select the even pages from a range of pages.

     The -_o option selects all of the odd pages; it may  be  used
     in conjunction with the other page selection options.

     The -_p_p_a_g_e_s option specifies  the  pages  which  are  to  be
     selected.   _P_a_g_e_s  is a comma separated list of page ranges,
     each of which may be a page number, or a page range  of  the
     form  _f_i_r_s_t-_l_a_s_t.  If  _f_i_r_s_t  is  omitted, the first page is
     assumed, and if _l_a_s_t is omitted, the last page is assumed.

     The prefix character `_' indicates that the page  number  is
     relative  to the end of the document, counting backwards. If
     just this character with no page number  is  used,  a  blank
     page will be inserted.

     The -_r option causes _p_s_s_e_l_e_c_t to output the  selected  pages
     in reverse order.

     Psselect normally prints the page numbers of the pages rear-
     ranged; the -_q option suppresses this.

     If any of the -_r, -_e, or -_o options are specified, the  page
     range  must  be  given with the -_p option. This is for back-
     wards compatibility with previous versions.


NOTES
     The page number given to _p_s_s_e_l_e_c_t is the number of the  page
     counting from the start or end of the file, starting at one.
     The actual page number in the document may be different.
