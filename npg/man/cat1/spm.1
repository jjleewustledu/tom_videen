NAME
     spm - Statistical Parametric Mapping


DESCRIPTION
     SPM  is  a  software  package   described   in   detail   at
     http://www.fil.ion.bpmf.ac.uk/spm/

     NPG software exists to convert image files to and  from  SPM
     format.   SPM  format  is  equivalent  to Analyze format but
     changes the row ordering to left-to-right; in  other  words,
     standard  SPM  images  are right/left reversed from standard
     Analyze images.

     Since SPM uses the same format  and  naming  conventions  as
     Analyze,  it is particularly easy to find left/right flipped
     in viewed images.  To avoid this, try to keep images format-
     ted  for  Analyze  and SPM separate.  Use img2spm to convert
     ECAT images that will be used as input for SPM  and  spm2img
     to convert them back to ECAT format.

     A variety of images are created during  SPM  processing  and
     can  be  viewed with vidi. However, to maintain orientation,
     always create an Interfile header using  spm2if.  Vidi  pre-
     ferentially  reads  an Interfile header if it exists and the
     npg standard for Interfile headers contains identifiers  for
     the  orientation (assuming that you got your images into SPM
     format properly oriented before processing).

     Images created by SPM:
          con_0002.img   - contrast #2
          spmT_0002.img  - t-images for contrast #2
          ResMS.img      - residual mean squared error
          RPV.img        - voxel resolution
          beta_0001.img  - parameter estimate for column 1 of design matrix

     Other files:
          xCon.mat  -    design contrasts matrix


TO RUN SPM
     type 'matlab' at the Unix prompt (you need a Matlab license)
     type 'spm pet' at the Matlab prompt

     Then follow the easy-to-use instructions in the examples  at
     the web site.
