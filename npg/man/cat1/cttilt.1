CTTILT(1)                 User Commands                 CTTILT(1)



NAME
     cttilt - reorient CT to correct for gantry tilt


SYNOPSIS
     cttilt inprefix outprefix gantrytilt


DESCRIPTION
     This program corrects a CT for gantry tilt after the CT  has
     already  been  converted to Analyze format (for instance, by
     running the program "ct2analyze").


OPERANDS
     inprefix - prefix of Analyze-format input files (.img, .hdr),
                e.g., "p5064n"
     outprefix - prefix of output files (.img, .hdr, .ifh),
                 e.g., "p5064r"
     gantrytilt - gantry tilt in degrees, e.g., "-25"

     Note: Use ctheader to determine gantry tilt. For instance:
           ctheader -v 3 3     # look at values for slice 3
     Make sure that you are not looking at a  localizer  (usually
     slice  1)  when  you  run  ctheader, as the gantry tilt will
     always be 0 for localizers.


EXAMPLE
     Convert an SSPLUS CT to Analyze  format  without  correcting
     for gantry tilt:
        ct2analyze 2 50 p5064n -n

     Determine the gantry tilt for the above image:
        ctheader 1 50     # determine which slice is localizer
        ctheader -v 2 2   # look at gantry tilt for non-localizer

     Reorient the above image to correct for gantry tilt:
        cttilt p5064n p5064r -25
