DESCRIPTION
     dcm_dump_file reads DICOM file headers and displays the con-
     tents, including:
          DICOM Tag (group and element number)
          data value length
          short English description
          some or all of the data for each tag

     Some files require the "-t"  flag  and  others  require  its
     absence. If you get lots of errors, try the opposite.
