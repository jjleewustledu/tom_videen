NAME
     sample_pts - reads an Analyze image and writes and plots all
     coordinates which contain non-zero values


SYNOPSIS
     sample_pts


DESCRIPTION
     The program prompts for a filename of an Analyze image (with
     extension  .img).   It then reads the file, gets the coordi-
     nates of all voxels which are non-zero and  writes  them  to
     the  screen.  Finally, it prompts for 2 dimensions and plots
     all coordinates on these 2 axes.

     It was intended to use with segmented fiducials to  identify
     outliers or errors in the segmentation.
