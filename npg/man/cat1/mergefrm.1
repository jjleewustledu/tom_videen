NAME
     mergefrm - copy single image frames into a multiframe  image
     file


SYNOPSIS
     mergefrm infile frm# outfile frm# [stdfile frm#]


DESCRIPTION
     mergefrm copies 1 frame of an image into another image file,
     assigning it to the specified frame number in that file.

     The optional standard file and frame  number  will  use  the
     header  information  from  that  file in creating the output
     file.  This is useful when the merged files  may  have  lost
     important  information during conversion to and from Analyze
     format (e.g., during image  realignment)  and  the  complete
     header information can be recovered from the original file.


EXAMPLE
     mergefrm rp5000g5.v 1 rp5000dyn.v 5
     mergefrm rp5000g5.v 1 rp5000dyn.v 5 p5000cg1.v 5
