NAME
     petproc -- Computes tissue activity conversion  factors  for
     PET  images.  Creates  hdr  (or HDR) files which are used by
     spideram  and  other  programs  requiring  tissue   activity
     values.


SYNOPSIS
     petproc subject_id


DESCRIPTION
     This program computes PETT count conversion factors for scan
     files obtained in pseudo-list mode (dynamic acquisition fol-
     lowed by creation of multiple scan files).  The current ver-
     sion supports the following:

     PET Image     File Type   PIE File Type
     PETT VI (old)  1000         3 or 4
     PETT VI (new)  1020         4 or 5
     ECAT 953B      3000            7

     The conversion factors are written to a  256-byte  HDR  file
     with  the same name as the image file with extension '.hdr'.
     These conversion factors are used  by  SPIDERAM  to  display
     images  as  tissue  activity  images  by converting the PETT
     counts for each pixel. The conversion factors in an HDR file
     may be displayed with the utility hdrinfo.

     Two conversion factors are computed.  One converts the  PETT
     counts  in  a  frame  directly  to well counts/ml/sec and is
     referred to as the non-decay-corrected PETT conversion  fac-
     tor.   The  second  converts  the  PETT counts in a frame to
     counts/ml/sec decay-corrected to the time of  administration
     and  is  referred  to as the decay-corrected PETT conversion
     factor.


ALGORITHM
     The program computes the non-decay-corrected PETT conversion
     factor using:

     PETTCONV = pieslope * 60 sec/min
                ---------------------
                 length of frame

     and program computes  the  decay-corrected  PETT  conversion
     factor using:

     PETTCONV = pieslope*60 sec/min *EXP(decay const * mean time)
                ------------------------------------------------
                              length of frame

     with units of:

          PETTCONV (well counts/ml/sec) / (PETT counts/scan)
          pieslope (well counts/ml/sec) / (PETT counts/min)
          decay constant (1/sec)
          mean time (sec)
          length of frame (sec/scan)


PIE FILE (input)
     A file of conversion factors for a given bank pair (known as
     'pie  slopes' in the local jargon) must exist for converting
     PETT counts/pixel to well counts/ml/sec.  These  files  have
     the  extension .pie or .PIE and are created with the utility
     piecreate.


IMAGE FILE (input)
     Petproc typically reads the headers of PETT image files dur-
     ing  processing,  but it may read HDR files instead.  If HDR
     files are read, the user must be certain that  the  original
     images  were  all  processed  with  the  same reconstruction
     stream as the phantoms used to generate the  PIE  files  (if
     images files are read, the program performs this check).


HDR FILE (output)
     An HDR file is created for each image processed.  These  are
     256-byte  files  with  the  extension .hdr and the same file
     name as the image file.   Their  contents  is  specified  in
     HDRFORM.FIL and may be read using the utility hdrinfo.


RCD FILE (output)
     An RCD file is created each time petproc is run.   This  has
     the extension .rcd and contains information about the param-
     eters chosen during processing of each image.  The following
     information appears in the RCD file for each scan frame:

          Processed by TOV  on 10/30/92 with petproc {27-Oct-92}
          Pie File used: p1678g.pie

          Frame Number    = 1
          File to Process = p1693s1.c
          HDR File        = p1693s1.hdr
          Start Time      = 2.0 seconds
          Scan Length     = 120.0 seconds
          Bank Pairs      = 0.7
          Pie Slope       = 14.0937
          Non-Decay-corrected:
             PETT Conversion Factor/Scan Period = 6.88611
          Decay-corrected to time of administration:

             (not included in the Pie Slope)


TIM.DAT FILE (output)
     A TIM.DAT file may be created  by  answering  'Y'  when  the
     option appears at the end of processing a set of scan files.
     This file is in  SPED-compatible  format  and  contains  the
     weighted  mean  time of each frame for all images processed.
     These times are the mid-time of each frame adjusted so  that
     half  the  activity  is recorded before and after it.  It is
     assumed that tracer concentration is constant so  that  with
     radioactive decay, measured acativity will decrease over the
     period of the frame.  These weighted mid-times are  computed
     with the formula:

          midtime = starttime +  -(1/tau) *
                        ln((exp(-tau*framelength)+1)/2)

     where tau (decay constant) and framelength are  in  seconds.
     These  weighted  mid-times  will  be  slightly less than the
     mid-time of each frame.



USING PETPROC
     To run petproc enter:  'petproc subject ID' where  the  sub-
     ject  ID  is  the  name  of  the RCD and TIM.DAT files to be
     created.  For example:

          petproc m100

     will create files m100.rcd and m100TIM.DAT in  your  current
     directory.

     The program allows the user to use a pie file to compute the
     pie  slope  from  a specified average bank pairs value.  The
     user enters his initials, the name of the old and  new  scan
     files, the start time and length of each file, and the aver-
     age pie slope.  The program has default  values  for  every-
     thing  except  the  user's  initials, the pie file name, the
     name of the first old scan file, and the average bank  pairs
     of the first file.

ANNOTATION OF THE PROMPTS
Enter the name of 1 image
     This image file is used to determine the type of reconstruc-
     tion that is used in all the images and is used to check the
     type of pie file that will be read in the next step.  Once a
     pie  file  has  been read, its type will be compared against
     all images that are processed.


Filter used in PETT VI reconstruction?
     Optional


Pie File Name?
     Enter the complete path.


Multiply pie factors by this efficiency?
     PETT VI sensitivity drifts  daily.   The  efficiency  factor
     computed  here is based on the total counts/sec in the blank
     scan compared with the same in the blank scan taken when the
     last  PIE  was  computed, factoring in decay of the Ge-68 in
     the ring source.  This factor is not necessary  (nor  is  it
     used) for ECAT images.



*** Average Bank Pairs 0.7 LESS
*** A Linear Extrapolation was made
     PIE files generally have factors for  5  bank  pair  values.
     When  the  bank  pairs value of your scan is outside of this
     range, a  linear  extrapolation  is  made  to  estimate  the
     conversion  factor  (referred  to as the PIE SLOPE).  Linear
     extrapolations at the low end are probably fairly reasonable
     as the curve is relatively flat;  they will be less reliable
     at the high end.
