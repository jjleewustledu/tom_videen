NAME
     fpattn7 - forward project EXACT HR attenuation correction


SYNOPSIS
     fpattn7 attn_image.v old_attn.a new_attn.a


DESCRIPTION
     fpattn7 forward projects a transmission image and creates an
     attenuation  file.   This new attenuation file can be copied
     to exacthr and used  to  re-reconstruct  emission  sinograms
     from a study.

     An old attenuation file  is  used  to  extract  file  header
     information.

     The utility of fpattn7 is in reconstructing all images of  a
     subject  using  a  common  attenuation  correction. When two
     transmission  scans  were  collected,  these  can  be  core-
     gistered,  averaged, forward-projected, and the average used
     to reconstruct all sinograms for the subject.

     The attenuation correction can be coregistered to each emis-
     sion  scan  using  the  alignment  matrix (air file) for the
     emission images.  By doing this, a difference image  created
     from coregistered emission images will not have noise due to
     the attenuation correction.
