NAME
     metproc -- Computes metabolic conversion factors which allow
     PET  images  to  be  displayed  as  CBF,  CBV, OEF, or CMRO2
     instead of merely counts. Creates hdr (or HDR)  files  which
     are  used by spideram, hd6mean, and other programs requiring
     metabolic values.


SYNOPSIS
     metproc subject_id


DESCRIPTION
     This program generates metabolic conversion factors for PETT
     images.  The current version supports 7-slice PETT VI images
     with types 1000 (old reconstruction) and  1020  (new  recon-
     struction)  and  pie file types 3-5.  The conversion factors
     are written to a 1-record HDR file with the same name as the
     image  file.   These conversion factors are used by SPIDERAM
     to display metabolic images by converting  the  PETT  counts
     for  each  pixel.  The conversion factors in an HDR file may
     be displayed with the utility HDRINFO.

     A modification added in Oct 1996 permits adjustment of blood
     curves  from  the  automated  blood  sampler using the ratio
     between one or more hand-sampled points entered at  the  end
     of  the  ABS curve (with at least 1 point with zero activity
     after the end of the ABS curve) and a linear fit to the tail
     of  the blood curve.  The number of points at the end of the
     blood curve default to 30 but may be changed.  The ratio  is
     incorporated  into  the PETT Efficiency Factor and is stored
     in the hdr files.  (A related IDL program, checkdtacal, will
     read  dta  files,  perform the linear regression and graphi-
     cally show the fit and is intended to be  used  to  evaluate
     this fudge factor).

     A new prompt "Adjust pie factor?" appears after the partiti-
     tion  coefficient is entered for each blood curve.  If used,
     the calculated "Blood sampler efficiency scaler"  represents
     the  ratio of the the mean hand-sampled point divided by the
     value fit using the tail  of  the  automated  blood  sampler
     curve (decay-corrected values).

     For now, this adjustment should work for HO  or  CO  curves,
     but  not  for OO.  If it is found useful I will modify it to
     detect the appropriate data for oxygen studies.


FILE REQUIREMENTS FOR USING METPROC
     Input Files:

     A blood curve must exist for each  image  to  be  processed.

     These are stored in files with the extension DTA (or DAT for
     older versions) and are  created  with  the  utility  BLOOD.
     Note that BLOOD decay-corrects the blood curve values.  MET-
     PROC restores this decay when each DTA file is read and com-
     putes its factors using non-decay-corrected blood curves.

     A file of PETT conversion factors for a given bank pair must
     exist  for  converting  PETT counts/pixel to well counts/ml.
     These files have the extension PIE and are created with  the
     utility PIECREAT.

     METPROC typically reads the headers of PETT image files dur-
     ing  processing,  but it may read HDR files instead.  If HDR
     files are read, the user must be certain that  the  original
     images  were  all  processed  with  the  same reconstruction
     stream as the phantoms used to generate the  PIE  files  (if
     images files are read, the program performs this check).

     Files Created:

     An HDR file is created for each image processed.  These  are
     1 record files with the extension HDR and the same file name
     as  the  image  file.   Their  contents  is   specified   in
     HDRFORM.FIL and may be read using the utility HDRINFO.

     An RCD file is created and printed each time METPROC is run.
     This contains information about the parameters chosen during
     processing of each image.  These printouts  should  be  kept
     with the subject files.



METABOLIC ALGORITHMS
     METPROC creates conversion factors for displaying images  as
     blood flow (CBF), blood volume (CBV), oxygen extraction (E),
     or oxygen utilization (CMRO2).  The  reader  should  consult
     the  references  for  these  models,  which are listed below
     along with the basic equations used by SPIDERAM  to  convert
     PETT  images to metabolic images with the conversion factors
     created by METPROC.

     Blood Volume (CBV):

     Requires CO scan
     Factors written to HDR file:
        NTYPE = 3
        BVFACTOR = blood volume factor
        (includes PETT conversion factor)

     CBV = PETT * BVFACTOR

     CBV = ml of blood/100g of brain

USING METPROC
     METPROC may be run from any account on any volume,  however,
     it  is  typically  run from the account the account on which
     the images are located (200 for PETT VI).  METPROC reads PIE
     files  from your group account, which should be 200 for PETT
     VI.  Since METPROC creates both HDR files and and RCD  file,
     it  should  not  be  run on SYS or the archive volumes (DT1,
     IMGn).  On RASPUTIN it is recommended that METPROC be run on
     TMP1.  The HDR files created will be archived on DT1 and the
     RCD file will be deleted by the system manager.  If you want
     to  keep  the  RCD  file,  you  should copy it to a personal
     volume.  If you are doing test processing  of  images  using
     non-standard parameters, you should create your HDR files on
     a personal volume.

     To run METPROC enter:  'METPROC filename'   where  the  file
     name  is  that  of  the DTA file (blood curve) to be used in
     processing.  The DTA file is assume to  have  the  extension

     DTA or DAT and no extension should be entered.  The RCD file
     created will have the same filename as the  DTA  file.   For
     example:

          METPROC DT1:P1000

     will read the file DT1:P1000.DTA as the blood curve and will
     create  a  file  P1000.RCD  and  files  P1000xxx.HDR on your
     current volume.

      WARNING:  If you REPROCESS HDR files, you must  be  certain

      If they were not, the wrong pie factor may be used.

     [[ In October 1988 a new PETT VI  reconstructin  stream  was

     HDR  files,  you must [[ be certain that all images and pies
