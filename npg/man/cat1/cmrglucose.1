NAME
     cmrglucose - creates a CMRGlucose image from an fdg image

SYNOPSIS
     cmrglucose img dta K1 k2 k3 k4 lc glucose pie t0 model out


PARAMETERS
     img - single-frame fdg image (sum of late frames);

     dta - fdg blood curve (dta file);

     K1, k2, k3, k4 - rate constants;
          units for k2, k3, k4 are 1/min
          units for K1 are ml/g/min (K1 = k1 * CBV/100)

     lc - lumped constant

     glucose - blood glucose concentration (microMoles/ml)
          must agree with the value in dta file;
          e.g., both must be either plasma or whole blood conc
          (molecular wt of glucose = 180.16 g/Mole)

     pie - pie factor (pie files are in /usr/local/npg/pie)

     t0 - sec after injection for start img

     model 0 = Huang's formula: Am J Physiol 238:E69-E82, 1980
           1 = Brooks' formula: J Nucl Med 23:538-539, 1982

     out - CMRGlucose image


NOTES
     CMRGlucose image has pixel values of 1000  *  (ml/100g/min).
     Using  the  header file created by cmrglucose, spideram will
     display and calculate regional values in proper units if the
     processing  is  selected  as "PROCESSED as CMRGlucose". How-
     ever, values from imgmean must be multiplied by 0.001.

     cmrglu is an IDL front  end  for  cmrglucose  which  permits
     interactive entry of all parameters.

     To create an fdg image from a dynamic image file, first  run
     imgfrms  to  determine  the  number and times of all frames,
     e.g.,
          imgfrms p5296fdg1.v

     Then sum the frames which cover  the  desired  time  period,
     e.g.,
          sumimgframes p5296fdg1.v p5296fdg0.v 42 47

     This particular example creates the single-frame  fdg  image
     p5296fdg0.v  with  a  start  time of 2880 sec (48 min) and a
     duration of 18 minutes.
