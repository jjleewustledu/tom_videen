NAME
     ctheader - print header information from CT image file


SYNOPSIS
     ctheader [ -v ] firstfile# lastfile#


DESCRIPTION
     ctheader prints selected  header  information  from  Siemens
     Somatom Plus CT images to stdout. If the -v option is speci-
     fied, it prints detailed information for  each  file  speci-
     fied.  Otherwise,  it  prints  only a summary for the set of
     files specified. The summary report includes  the  following
     information:

      - Patient name and birthdate
      - Mismatched files (if any) by patient name and birth
      - Exam date and time
      - Mismatched files (if any) by exam date and time
      - Scout (localizer) filenames or "None"

     This  program  is  intended  to  be  run  prior  to  running
     ct2analyze.  Its  main  purpose is to show which image files
     are localizers (scouts; topograms), as investigators may not
     want  to  include these localizers when they run ct2analyze.
     Usually file 00001.ima is a localizer,  but  sometimes  file
     00002.ima is a localizer also.

     In addition, ctheader checks to see that all  images  speci-
     fied  are  from  the same patient and the same date. It does
     this by extracting the patient  name  and  birth  date,  and
     study  date/time,  from  the  first file specified, and then
     comparing this to each of the other files. The patient  name
     and  birth  date,  and  study date/time, from the first file
     appear in the printout as the "correct" values.  Any  values
     from  other  files that do not match these are considered to
     be in error. For instance, if the study  date  and  time  in
     file  00003.ima  did not match that in the first file speci-
     fied (00001.ima, most likely), the following would appear on
     the screen:

     Study date and time: 19-OCT-1995 13:44
        --->Error: 00003.ima doesn't match: 25-SEP-1995 13:52

     This program reads multiple, sequential  CT  images  of  the
     Siemens  Somatom  Plus file format. Filenames are assumed to
     have extension "ima" and to contain exactly  5  digits,  and
     only 5 digits, not including the extension, e.g., 00001.ima,
     00002.ima, 00003.ima,..., 00042.ima. Only the integer values
     of  the  first and last file need to be specified, e.g., "1"
     and "42". Leading zeros are optional.

OPERANDS
     firstfile#: Integer value from filename of first image  file
     in  desired  set  -- e.g., if first file is 00001.ima, first
     num would be "1". Leading zeros are  also  accepted  ("001",
     "0001", etc.).

     lastfile#: Integer value from filename of last image file in
     desired  set  --  e.g.,  if last file is 00042.ima, last num
     would be  42".  Leading  zeros  are  also  accepted  ("042",
     "0042", etc.).


OPTIONS
     -v: (verbose) Print detailed  header  information  for  each
     file  specified. If -v option is not specified, only summary
     is printed (pt. name, birthdate, and exam date and time).

     TP = axial table position (mm)
     TI = exposure time (sec)
     kV = generator voltage (kilovolts)
     SL = slice thickness (mm)
     mAs = exposure dose = tube current (milliamps) x time (sec)
     GT = gantry tilt (degrees) - see "Gantry Tilt" below
     ZO = zoom
     CE = center of image in field, x axis (mm)
          center of image in field, y axis (mm)
     "TH 7502" or "AH 7572" -  meaning not yet known
         'A' probably = axial
         'T' probably = topogram (scout)
         'H' = head?
     "H/SP", etc. = patient orientation
         'H'=head-first, 'F'=feet-first
         'SP'=supine, 'PR'=prone,

NOTES
     Date formats
     ------------
     Exam date and patient birthdate in summary report  represent
     whatever  was  typed in by the technician at the time of the
     exam. Date formats appear to vary. For instance, 10-7-95 may
     represent  October  7,  1995,  or  it may represent July 10,
     1995. Common formats are MM-DD-YY, DD-MM-YY,  and  YY-MM-DD.
     Although   date   formats   are   not   consistent   between
     patients/exams, they are  consistent  within  a  given  exam
     since  the  same character string is repeated in each header
     for the exam. Therefore, the date string can be used to ver-
     ify  that  images belong together (are from the same patient
     and date), even if the meaning of the  date  string  is  not
     clear. If the exam date in the ctheader summary looks amibi-
     guous, use the -v option to look at detailed info.  for  one
     or  more slices. The date reported for each individual slice
     comes from a scanner-generated date/time, and is printed  in
     the  format DD-MMM-YYYY. If the patient birthdate is ambigu-
     ous, other medical records for the patient will have  to  be
     consulted.

     Siemens Somatom Plus image file format
     --------------------------------------
     We have examined Siemens Somatom Plus CT files from the fol-
     lowing  time  period: Nov., 1993 through the present (April,
     1996). The file size and format appears to  have  been  con-
     sistent  during this time period, but we don't know for sure
     that it was the same before this time  period,  or  that  it
     will  remain  the same. Currently (April, 1996), the Siemens
     Somatom Plus image files are 528384 bytes in size. The first
     4096  bytes  contain  the  header,  and the following 524288
     bytes contain the image (pixel) data.
