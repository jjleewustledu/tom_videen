NAME
     imgconvol -    convolve a image  to  create  an  image  with
     specified FWHM


SYNOPSIS
     imgconvol infile outfile resolution


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads a image in Analyze format which it treats
     as  a  tissue  image.   It  then  filters  this  image in 3-
     dimensions to create a  blurred  tissue  image  intended  to
     match the resolution of the PET images.

     A Gaussian filter kernel is  computed  separately  for  each
     dimension using the specified final resolution and the pixel
     dimensions of the image.  The pixel dimensions of the  input
     image are read as mm and the resolution is assumed to be the
     FWHM in mm.  The input  image  is  assumed  to  be  a  high-
     resolution, unfiltered anatomical image.

     The program uses an IDL runtime license and hold the  entire
     image  in memory (for large CT or MRI images, use a worksta-
     tion with suffient RAM).

     To determine the resolution of PET images, see the man  page
     for gauss.

     The program does not pad at the edges of the matrix prior to
     filtering,  which can cause filtering artifacts at the edges
     of the image. If these are a problem, pad your images  prior
     to this filter.

     Values of sigma which appear  during  processing  are  those
     used  to  compute  the Gaussian kernel for each image dimen-
     sion. These, along with the input  image  matrix  and  pixel
     sizes  and the filter halfwidths in each dimension give some
     clue as to what is being computed.
