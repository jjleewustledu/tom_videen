NAME
     fit_fiducials  -  reads  9  Analyze  images  containing  the
     branches  of  3 fiducial N's and computes the coordinates of
     the intersections of each of the branches (6 points)


SYNOPSIS
     fit_fiducials


DESCRIPTION
     This program requests the rootname for  a  set  of  9  files
     which contain the 3 branches of 3 fiducial N's on the monkey
     chair use for PET and MR studies.  The rootname may be  any-
     thing,  but the program expects the filenames to be the fol-
     lowing (where the root is "mr16"):

     mr16topzbtm.img
     mr16topzdiag.img
     mr16topztop.img
     mr16rtzbtm.img
     mr16rtzdiag.img
     mr16rtztop.img
     mr16backndiag.img
     mr16backnlf.img
     mr16backnrt.img

     The program uses linear regression to fit  lines  to  points
     defining  each  of the fiducials.  It is constrained so that
     the end-branches of each N are parallel and separated  by  a
     known distance and the angle of the center branch is known.

     The Analyze header is read to determine  the  dimensions  of
     each  input  image, and if this header is incorrect you will
     get an error something like:

     % READU: End of file encountered. Unit: 100
              File: n16topztop.img
     % Execution halted at FIT_FIDUCIAL_N </data/npggw/idl/tom/fit_fiducial_N.pro(  84)>

     If this happens, you will have to fix the hdr file by either
     recreating  the  Analyze  images or by using the Header Edit
     function within Analyze.


OUTPUT
     Program output is to a file <rootname>.fid which  will  con-
     tain the coordinates of the 6 points of intersection.  Exam-
     ple:
