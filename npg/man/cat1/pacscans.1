NAME
     pacscans - identifies DICOM scans by series number


SYNOPSIS
     pacscans root


DESCRIPTION
     pacscans reads PACS DICOM files in a directory,  sorts  them
     by series number, then writes:

     1) first and last filenames in each series
     2) sequence filename
     3) subject name, study date, orientation, image dimensions,
        and pixel dimensions

     This information is save in a file Scans.lst.

     PACS DICOM files appear to use the naming convention:

          1.3.12.2.1107.5.2.4.7602.20020109114334000002004

     where the initial fields are all common for  a  study  while
     the last field (following the last dot) identifies:
          20020109  = date (yyyymmdd)
          114334    = time (hhmmss)
          000  = ?
          002  = series number
          004  = image number
