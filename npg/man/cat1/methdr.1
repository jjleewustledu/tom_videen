NAME
     methdr - Create hdr files  from  METEVAL-processed  PETT  VI
     image files.


SYNOPSIS
     methdr rootname


DESCRIPTION
     METEVAL was the precursor of metproc.  Both programs created
     conversion   coefficients  which  allow  PET  images  to  be
     displayed as metabolic images.  METEVAL used  somewhat  dif-
     ferent  equations  to  apply the same models as metproc (see
     Videen  et  al,  JCBFM  7:513  for  revisions  in  metproc).
     METEVAL  also  wrote  the  coefficients  to  the  image file
     whereas metproc writes them to a separate hdr file.

     Methdr will read the coefficients from an old PETT VI  image
     file  and  use  them to create an hdr file.  The hdr file is
     required by spideram.  Without the hdr  file,  METEVAL  pro-
     cessed  images  can  only  be  displayed as PET counts or as
     metabolic images using METDISP on  Medusa  or  another  Con-
     current Computer.

     The hdr files created will not be complete as not all infor-
     mation  (e.g.,  PIE file name, PETT Efficiency) is available
     from the image header.  However, all  critical  coefficients
     for display and ROI-processing of metabolic images is filled
     in.
