NAME
     img2analyze - converts PET image files (ECAT or PETT VI for-
     mat)  to  ANALYZE  files (img & hdr) and an Interfile Format
     header file (ifh).


SYNOPSIS
     img2analyze <PET filename> <ANALYZE root>

     The complete PET filename must be specified,  but  only  the
     rootname  for  the  Analyze file. The program will automati-
     cally add the extensions "img", "hdr", and "ifh" to the out-
     put files.


DESCRIPTION
     img2analyze reads any PET image handled by our library  rou-
     tines  (PETT VI and ECAT) reorients them to the 3-D ordering
     expected by Analyze and creates 4 output files:  img and hdr
     files  for  Analyze,  an Interfile Format header file (ifh),
     plus a color lookup table used for PET images.

     The PET images are re-ordered so that left brain will appear
     on  the  right  and slice 1 will be the bottom of the brain.
     The Analyze orientation will match  labels  within  Analyze.
     Note  that  Analyze  thinks  in radiological orientation and
     displays right-on-left (viewing the body from the feet).

     When an image file has a z-origin in the comment field, then
     img2analyze  will write this origin along with the midpoints
     of the x- and y-dimensions to the .ifh files as  the  "atlas
     origin".   It also writes an "atlas name", currently assumed
     to be "Talariach 1988".

     If you need a PET color table for Analyze, copy the one from
     /usr/local/npg/lib/analyze/pet.lkup
