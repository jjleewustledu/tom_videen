NAME
     includeres - filter to include  resources  in  a  PostScript
     document

SYNOPSIS
     includeres < _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t._p_s > _o_u_t_p_u_t._p_s

DESCRIPTION
     _I_n_c_l_u_d_e_r_e_s includes resources  (fonts,  procsets,  patterns,
     files,  etc)  in  place  of  %%_I_n_c_l_u_d_e_R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e comments in a
     PostScript document. The resources are searched for  in  the
     current directory and the system default directory under the
     resource name, and with an appropriate extension.  The pipe-
     line

               extractres file.ps | includeres >out.ps

     will move all resources appearing in a document to the docu-
     ment  prologue,  removing  redundant copies. The output file
     can then be put through page re-arrangement filters such  as
     _p_s_n_u_p or _p_s_t_o_p_s safely.

FILES
     /usr/local/share/psutils - system resource directory.
