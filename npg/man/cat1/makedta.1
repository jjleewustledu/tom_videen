NAME
     makedta - creates a blood curve "dta" file

SYNOPSIS
     makedta


DESCRIPTION
     Makedta runs interactively, creating  a  blood  curve  (dta)
     file.   The dta file is necessary for further metabolic pro-
     cessing with metproc.

     Makedta uses 2 input files for each scan:

     1) A deconvolved, decay-corrected  blood  curve  (dcv)  file
     (created by betadcv);

     2) A head curve file (extension "plt" for 953 or "r" for 961
     data) created at the time of the PET scan;

     Makedta shifts the arterial blood curve to  create  a  blood
     curve  for the head. This curve, plus other information such
     as the visual delay, are written to a dta file.

     The dta file created will have 2 columns:
          1) time (secs)
          2) shifted, decay-corrected, deconvolved blood curve

     An IDL license is necessary to run makedta.


TIMES & SHIFTS
     1) The blood curve is decay-corrected by betadcv. Therefore,
     the  beginning  of the blood curve should ALWAYS be the zero
     time.

     2) The start time for the PET (aka the visual delay) is  the
     start  time  of the data acquisition frame (frame 2 for most
     oxygen scans) with respect to the  zero  time.  The  program
     estimates  the  PET start time by subtracting the scan dura-
     tion (40 or 300 sec) from the end of the  head  curve.   The
     end time is determined by interpolating between the last two
     non-zero times in the head curve weighing by  the  ratio  of
     the  last  trues  rate  to the next-to-last trues rate (this
     assumes relatively constant activity at the end of the  scan
     frame).   However, this estimate will ONLY be correct if the
     scanner clock was reset at the zero time (by starting  frame
     1).  The standard CO scan has a visual delay of 15 (with the
     blood curve started 15 sec prior to the  5  minute  acquisi-
     tion).

     3) The start of PET frame 1 relative to  zero  time  can  be

     determined  as  follows.  (a) IF the scanner clock was reset
     at the beginning of frame 1, it will be 0 (this depends upon
     the  PET  operator).  (b)  Take the last clock time from the
     head curve (reading times from the last column) and subtract
     the  scan  duration  plus visual delay. The result should be
     the frame 1 start time in msec. (c) Take the injection  time
     from  the  PET  operator's notes, correct for the difference
     between the wall clock and computer clock and find this time
     in  first column of the head curve.  The last column of this
     row should be frame 1 start time in msec.

     4)  The  arterial  curve  is  shifted  until   its   takeoff
     corresponds to the takeoff of the head curve. Do not use the
     visual delay or start of frame 2 to  calculate  the  takeoff
     times--this  is  entirely  a  visual  match of the 2 curves.
     Recognize that the amplitudes of both curves are  normalized
     in the plot.  The zoom feature is intended to assist visual-
     izing the takeoffs.  The theoretically best way to shift  is
     unknown,  but what is described corresponds to current prac-
     tice.


NOTES
     While makedta handles all 961 .r files and  most  953B  .plt
     files,  it  fails  for  some early .plt files.  These can be
     recognized by the content of the last (tenth)  column  which
     should  be ACS time in msec for the plt files which are pro-
     cessed correctly.  The plt files which will  not  work  have
     something called "IPC Total" in this last column, which is a
     summation of counts and not time.
