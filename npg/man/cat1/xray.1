NAME
     xray - Create SXR files based on skull xray tracings and PET
     image files. It is the Unix version of _s_a_r_p_l_o_c_s.


SYNOPSIS
     xray _s_x_r_f_i_l_e [_r_a_s_f_i_l_e _i_m_g_f_i_l_e _t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d _p_e_a_k_t_y_p_e _t_r_i_m]


THE REFERENCE SLICE
     The  default  reference  slice  is  the  lead   line.   This
     corresponds to slice 16 if the offset is zero.

     The default reference slice used is slice 16.  However,  the
     user  can  change  the reference slice in the ``Parameters''
     menu. To make sure that the reference slice falls inside the
     brain, the following heuristic algorithm is used:

     1) Find all the slices that have the maximum length  on  the
     skull x ray inside the brain. The default reference slice is
     used to compute the lengths.

     2) Pick the center slice which has the maximum length as the
     new reference slice. If the center slice is greater than 28,
     use slice 28 as the new reference slice. On the other  hand,
     if  the  center slice is less than 4, slice 4 is used as the
     new reference slice.

     The above algorithm is hidden from the user and  is  applied
     automatically  after the user selected ``Initialize'' in the
     ``Parameters'' menu. Please take a look of the skull xray to
     make  sure  the reference slice selected by the algorithm is
     inside the brain.

     If the reference slice selected by the program falls outside
     the brain, please select a slice inside the brain as the new
     reference slice in  the  ``Parameters''  menu.  Then  select
     ``Recompute''  to  recompute  all  the parameters. It is not
     necessary to define the reference points  (glabella,  inion,
     etc.) again.

     If you think the peak slice is fine,  You  can  either  type
     "Cancel"  or  you can simply type "Save" on the menu bar and
     then "Quit".


PRINTING
     Either the skull xray or the PET image can  be  saved  as  a
     window  dump  file  and  be  printed.  Right  now, it can be
     printed on the QMS color PostScript printer.  Do  not  print
     the  files  during  the peak hours; use batch files to print
     images in the evenings.

DESCRIPTION
     xray creates a SXR file from an xray tracing and a PET image
     file.  The SXR file is used in _h_d_6_m_e_a_n and _t_8_8_m_e_a_n. The xray
     tracing should be a grayscale Sun raster file. The PET image
     can be a 7-slice PETT VI image or a 31-slice ECAT image. For
     ECAT images, it is recommended that the images  be  filtered
     by the Gaussian filter with half frequency 0.2.

     For parameters not specified, the following default  parame-
     ters are used:

      sxrfile:         .sxr is automatically used as the root.
      rasfile:         .ras is added to output file root to
                       search for Sun raster files.
      imgfile:         .img is added to output file root for
                       searching PET images.
      threshold:       40 for PETT VI emission scans; 50 for ECAT
                       emission scans; 80 for transmission scans.
      peaktype:        peak per scan.
      trim:            2 for transmission images; 0 for emission
                       images.

     The Sun raster file corresponding to  the  xray  tracing  is
     created  using  the  Microtech  scanner and a Macintosh com-
     puter. It is transferred to the Sun workstations where it is
     converted  to grayscale Sun raster format (See below: ``Pro-
     cessing Steps'').


PARAMETERS
      _s_x_r_f_i_l_e:       output file containing skull xray and PET
                     image parameters.

                     image to define the edges of the brain.

      _p_e_a_k_t_y_p_e:      1: threshold computed using peak for each
                     slice; 2: threshold computed using peak for
                     the whole scan.

     to SXR files into a 4 step process:

        1. scan the tracing into the Macintosh using the
           Microtech flat bed scanner
        2. transfer the tracing pict file to the Sun workstations
        3. convert the pict file to a Sun Rasterfile (.ras) with
           appropriate orientation
        4. run the program xray (1) using the .ras  file  and  an
     image
           file and create an output .sxr file

     Place xray tracing on the Microtech  scanner  bed  with  the
     front  of  the  transparency against the glass, the glabella
     near the top and the inion near the bottom. Use the scale on
     the  scanner  bed to note the appropriate size of a bounding
     box which includes all of  the  tracing,  the  glabella  and
     inion  markers,  the ear marks and center slice marks. It is
     preferable but not necessary for this box to be close to the
     brain  dimension  as  opposed  to  being  much larger. Place
     several sheets of legal size white paper over the tracing to
     provide a uniformly white background for the tracing.

     Close the lid on the scanner.

     Select _M_i_c_r_o_t_e_k _C_o_l_o_r from the Apple menu, i.e., the icon in
     the  far  upper  left  corner  of the Macintosh screen.  The
     parameters in the window MUST be:
        SCSI 6
        Brightness:  Red:+21  Green:+21  Blue:+21
        Resolution:  100 dpi
        Scaling:     100%
        Save Format: PICT2 (Paint)

     Position the bounding box in the display window on the right
     of  the  scanner  bed to agree with the size that you deter-
     mined above. Press the SCAN button. For the filename use the
     subject  number followed by .pic. When scanning is finished,
     you can quit the application.

     Run on the workstations. The program requires an image  file
     in  addition  to  the  .ras file.  This image file should be
     Gaussian filtered at 0.2 and from a scan with minimal  brain
     activation.

     Under the Parameters window enter the following values:
        ECAT scanner bed horizontal position during the xray
        ECAT scanner bed horizontal position during the scans
        The OFFSET value will  be  automatically  calculated  for

     Select Xray and follow the  instructions.  After  the  skull
     xray  with  the AC-PC line is drawn on the screen, check the
     position of the reference slice. It  should  be  inside  the
     brain.  If  the reference slice is outside the brain, please
     go back to the ``Parameters'' menu and redefine  the  refer-
     ence slice to recompute the parameters.

     Select WinDump and save the drawing on the screen in a  win-
     dow dump file.

     Select PET and make sure that the template displayed  around
     each  of  the slices is correct; specifically look for noise
     pixels which make the template have an incorrect odd shape.

     Select Save.

     Select Quit.


HISTORY
     For xray version 3.0 by Tom Yang, the file type is 20.
     For xray version 3.1 by Tom Yang, the file type is 21.

     xray version 3.2 by Tom Yang (09/21/94 and 11/01/94)
      a) Allow the user to see which slice has the peak PET activity;
      b) Allow the user to select which slice to use for the threshold peak;
      c) Save this peak slice number in the sxr file;
      d) The file type is 22.

     The  following  calibrations  apply  to  the  953B  for  all
     acquisitions after Oct 1994:
      e) Distance from line on cassette to the center of slice 16 = 351.7 mm;
      f) Magnification factor at center of head = 0.9325.


NOTES
     If processing ECAT Version 7 images, scale them by  10000000
     or they won't have proper values in xray (i.e., their values
     will all be < 1).

     The raster file representing the x-ray is  assumed  to  have
     100 dots per inch.
