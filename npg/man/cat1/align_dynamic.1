Name
     align_dynamic - align all frames of a dynamic image


SYNOPSIS
     align_dynamic root ext brainmask frms thresh blur resample_air
          root = input filename root minus frame number
          ext  = input file extension
          brainmask = image mask used for fit and to estimate mean
             pixel shift
          frms = frame numbers to align
          thresh = inverse of ratio of image max used to determine
               pixels in cost function
          blur = filter applied in alignlinear
          resample_air = AIR file used to resample images prior to
               alignlinear


DESCRIPTION
     An overview of dynamic image alignment is described  in  the
     man page aligning_dynamic, and you are urged to read that. A
     number of steps are  typically  required  before  and  after
     align_dynamic which are not described here.

     The input files to align_dynamic  are  single-frame  Analyze
     format.

     The reference image is in ECAT format and typically  is  any
     image  masked  to  brain.   It's  choice does not affect the
     alignment. The estimated mean voxel shift  in  X,  Y  and  Z
     dimensions  are  derived  from  the mean shift of all voxels
     within the masked volume in this image.

     The threshold is applied to  each  image  of  each  pair  of
     sequential  images which are aligned (prior to any filtering
     by AIR). The threshold determines  those  voxels  which  are
     used  to  compute  the cost function in AIR. It is chosen to
     catch, on average, all voxels within brain and none  of  the
     noise  or scatter from outside the brain.  It is undoubtedly
     the quirkiest aspect of the alignment, and not just  because
     it is specified as an inverse ratio (e.g., "4" is applied as
     0.25 times the image maximum).  The image maximum  is  taken
     directly  from  each input image frame (which can be a noisy
     estimate in low-count  frames)  and  the  ideal  ratio  will
     change as the tracer-concentration varies from widespread to
     localized. This approach, when it works, minimizes effort by
     the user. However, you are probably better using the routine
     "align_dynamic_mask" which uses an image mask  that  defines
     the volume in which the cost function is computed.

     Blur is applied in all 3  dimensions  of  each  input  image
     frame.  The number specifies the FWHM of the gaussian filter

     applied in whatever units the Analyze image header describes
     the image.

     The resample_air file is an AIR file created to resample the
     input  image  into a different pixel size in order to remove
     bias due to  pixelization  (see  Andersson,  1998,  and  man
     aligning_dynamic  for more details). There are several stan-
     dard resampling  files  which  have  been  created  (all  in
     /usr/local/npg/air)  which  have  the  corresponding inverse
     transform to restore the pixel dimensions after reslicing.
