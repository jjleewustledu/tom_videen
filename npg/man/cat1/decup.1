NAME
     decup - remove beam-hardening artifact


SYNOPSIS
     decup input output


PARAMETERS
     input   - filename of input image
     output  - filename of output image


DESCRIPTION
     The intent of this program is to eliminate the beam  harden-
     ing  effect from CT images of the brain sufficiently to per-
     form semi-automatic segmentation.

     This program reads an ANALYZE image and identifies all  pix-
     els  within each slice which are >= 10 and <= 75 (HU). These
     values are specified in the shell (transparent to the  user)
     and  are  intended  to restrict the 'normalization' to brain
     pixels, reducing the contribution  of  both  CSF  and  blood
     clots.

     Using these pixels, it computes  the  arithmetic  center  of
     each  slice. It then uses an algorithm introduced by Mott et
     al, 1985 (Br J Radiol 58:876) which computes the mean inten-
     sity  of  radial  rings in each slice, where the radius is a
     proportion of the distance from the edge to the  center.  It
     then  computes the difference between this mean and 35 (HU),
     which each slice of the image is assumed to have  been  nor-
     malized to (using slicenrm). For any ring in which this mean
     difference is greater than 35, the difference is  subtracted
     from each pixel in the ring.

     This masked image is written to the output file  in  ANALYZE
     format.
