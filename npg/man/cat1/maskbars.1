MASKBARS(1)               User Commands               MASKBARS(1)



NAME
     maskbars - mask headholder bars out of a transmission image


SYNOPSIS
     maskbars input output #xpixels #ypixels


PARAMETERS
     input     - filename of image to be masked
     output    - filename of output image
     #xpixels  - number of columns to remove at each lower corner
     #ypixels  - number of rows to remove at each lower corner


DESCRIPTION
     This program sets all pixel values to zero within 2  rectan-
     gles  located  at  the  lower  left and right corners. It is
     intended to remove the presence of the  headholder  bars  in
     953B transmission images so that xray will not include these
     in the threshold which determines the head size.

     The output image file will have the same format as the input
     file (e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).


EXAMPLE
     maskbars p2000tr1.img p2000tr1msk.img 24 38
