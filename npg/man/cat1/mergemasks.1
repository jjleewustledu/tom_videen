NAME
     mergemasks - combine multiple masks


SYNOPSIS
     mergemasks outfile infile1 infile2 [infile3 infile4 ...]


DESCRIPTION
     Mergemasks reads the first input file to  outfile  and  then
     reads  all  additional input files setting all pixels in the
     first file to zero which are zero in any of the other files.

     If all input files are masks, the output will  be  the  com-
     bined mask.

     If the first input file is not a mask, the  output  will  be
     this  input  file masked by the combination of all the other
     files.
