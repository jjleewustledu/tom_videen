NAME
     imghisto - creates histograms of pixel values in an image


SYNOPSIS
     imghisto


DESCRIPTION
     Imghisto runs interactively, creating  histograms  of  pixel
     values  in  an image.  The program reads PET, ECAT, Analyze,
     and Interfile file formats and can use hdr files to  convert
     pixels  to  metabolic  values.  Histograms may be plotted to
     your display screen, to a printer, or saved as a table which
     can  be  read into another spreadsheet, analysis or plotting
     program.  Errors and other messages during processing appear
     in a text field at the bottom of the menu.

     Filenames for the primary  image  and  an  optional  masking
     image are entered by selecting the "File" or "Mask" buttons.
     The type of processing is selected from the buttons  on  the
     right (Counts, CBF, CBV, OEF, CMRO2). None of the images are
     read until you select Process, at which point  you  will  be
     prompted for any additional files needed for processing (hdr
     files and additional HO and CO files for oxygen processing).

     A histogram of pixel values will be computed for  the  range
     of  slices  you select in the Image Slice Min and Max fields
     (remember to enter  return  after  changing  any  values  in
     boxes).  If  a masking image is selected, only pixels in the
     primary image will be used which have values in the mask  >=
     to  the  value  you  specify  in the Mask Pixels field. (The
     threshold of the mask image should be specified in counts).

     After changing any of the fields for the image, mask,  slice
     range,  or  type  of  processing,  you must select "Process"
     before new histograms will be created  (a  reminder  message
     will appear in the message field). However, histogram param-
     eters (min, max, and bin size) and the mask threshold may be
     changed and displayed without further processing.

     "Plot" displays the histogram, "Save" writes to  a  file  in
     SPED  format with the first 2 columns containing the minimum
     and maximum for each bin, and "Print" prints  the  histogram
     on your default printer.


NOTES
     The program requires an IDL license.

     Numbers which you type into fields in the menu will  not  be
     entered unless you follow them by RETURN.

     The maximum value for OEF is fixed at 1.  To  display  these
     values,  the  histogram  maximum must be > 1 (i.e., use 0 to
     1.1 with bin size = 0.1).
