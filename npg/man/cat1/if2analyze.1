NAME
     if2analyze - creates an ANALYZE header file  (hdr)  from  an
     Interfile header file (ifh)


SYNOPSIS
     if2analyze rootname

     The program automatically  adds  the  extensions  "ifh"  and
     "img"  to  the  input  filenames  and  "hdr"  to  the output
     filename.


DESCRIPTION
     if2analyze reads an Interfile header and uses  its  informa-
     tion  to  create  an Analyze header. It also reads the image
     file and finds  the  minimum  and  maximum  values  for  the
     Analyze header.


RESTRICTIONS
     The program currently expects 3-dimensional images in  short
     integer  format  in  radiological  orientation.  If it finds
     something else, it creates a header but warns  you  that  it
     may not behave properly in Analyze.


EXAMPLE
     if2analyze atest
