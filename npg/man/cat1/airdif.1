NAME
     airdif - compares the difference between 2 air files


SYNOPSIS
     airdif a.air b.air [maskimage]


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads 2 air files and computes  the  difference
     between  them.  If a mask image is given, the vector differ-
     ences between all pixels with values > 0 in that image  will
     be  computed  using  the  matrices  specified in the two air
     files and the average differences in mm will be displayed.

     The .air files are created by alignlinear (Roger Woods'  AIR
     package).  Either version 1 and 2 air files may be used.

     The mask image must be in ECAT or PETT VI format.
