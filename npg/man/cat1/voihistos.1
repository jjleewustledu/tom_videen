NAME
     voihistos - plot histograms of vois in an image


SYNOPSIS
     voihistos imagefile voifile


DESCRIPTION
     This program plots pixel intensity histograms of csf,  white
     matter,  gray-matter, and blood clot and determine the boun-
     daries of these 4 tissue types.

     It requires CT image of brain in Analyze format  and  a  voi
     file  with  5  defined  vois with the names: 'csf', 'white',
     'gray', 'clot', 'brain'.  Each VOI should contain  at  least
     1000  pixels  (more is better).  VOIs are defined using vidi
     and may contain multiple regions from multiple slices.

     VOI histograms are normalized to a peak of 1000 and  plotted
     in color.  In addition, the program identifies (where 'cnts'
     = counts per bin normalized to peak bin counts):

     Brain Min (5%) Threshold = first bin with <= 5% peak cnts
     Brain Max (5%) Threshold = last bin +1 with >= 5% peak cnts
     Brain/CSF Boundary       = first bin where white cnts >= CSF cnts
     Brain/Clot Boundary      = first bin where clot cnts >= gray cnts

     which are used in CT segmentation programs.


EXAMPLE
     voihistos p5067seg4.img p5067brain.voi


NOTES
     The program requires an IDL license.
