NAME
     dcm_ctheader - prints DICOM CT header info


SYNOPSIS
     dcm_ctheader <firstfile> <lastfile> [-tv] [-all] [-debug ]

     where:
          -t           Print list of table positions.
          -v (verbose) Print detailed header info. for each file.
          -all         Print all implemented DICOM field names and values
                       as they appear in DICOM file (ascii - no conversion
                       from yyyymmdd to mm/dd/yy, for instance)


DESCRIPTION
     dcm_ctheader reads the specified DICOM  files  and  displays
     header info.

     The non-verbose summary includes the study date,  time,  and
     subject  name.  It identifies any localizer scans and dupli-
     cate bed positions.

     The verbose summary includes the scanner id, table position,
     gantry tilt, beam kv and mA, plus other information.

     The conversion program dcm_ct2analyze requires a  continuous
     set of file numbers with no duplicate positions or localizer
     scans.  If duplicates are  removed  or  deleted,  sequential
     numbering can be restored with dcm_reorder.

     Input DICOM files must be named with a 5 digit  number  fol-
     lowed  by the extension .dcm; i.e., "00001.dcm". The program
     "dcm_rename" will convert DICOM filenames to names with this
     format.


EXAMPLES
     dcm_ctheader 1 42        [Summary only for files 00001.dcm - 00042.dcm]
     dcm_ctheader -v 3 6      [Detailed info for files 00003.dcm - 00006.dcm]
     dcm_ctheader -v 1 1      [Detailed info. for file 00001.dcm only]
     dcm_ctheader -vt 2 47    [Include list of table positions]
     dcm_ctheader -debug 3 45 [Include debugging info.]
     dcm_ctheader -a 3 44     [Print all DICOM field values, in original format]
