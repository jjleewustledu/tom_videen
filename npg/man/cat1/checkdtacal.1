NAME
     checkdtacal - check calibration in a dta file


SYNOPSIS
     checkdtacal


DESCRIPTION
     This program is intended to  be  used  as  a  test  for  the
     adjustment of the pieslope in metproc which may be necessary
     for data in which the automated blood sampler (ABS) calibra-
     tion  had  drifted.   It  compares  a  linear fit the decay-
     corrected tail of a blood curve collected with the ABS  with
     a hand-sampled point entered in the dta file.

     Each dta file curve  must  contain  one  hand-sampled  point
     entered  after  the  end  of  the ABS curve (with at least 1
     point with zero activity after the end of  the  ABS  curve).
     The  program reads a dta file and plots each curve, one at a
     time.  A linear fit is made to the tail of the blood  curve,
     and  the  fit  line is plotted.  The number of points at the
     end of the blood curve default is user-selected.

     A runtime IDL license is required for this program.
