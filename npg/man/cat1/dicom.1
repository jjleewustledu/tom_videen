NAME
     dicom - routines for manipulating DICOM image files


DESCRIPTION
     All of these routines should have their own man pages.  This
     summary  is  intended  as  an aid to finding the the correct
     routine.


FILE NAMES
     Files retrieved from PACS the naming convention:

          1.3.12.2.1107.5.2.4.7602.20020109114334000002004

     where the initial fields are common for a  study  while  the
     last field (following the last dot) identifies:
          20020109  = date (yyyymmdd)
          114334    = time (hhmmss)
          000  = ?
          002  = series number
          004  = image number

     Note that some CT PACS images have a different  naming  con-
     vention (an extra field at the end, i.e., ".4").

     Files sent from East Bldg MR scanners have names:

          .MR..2.1.2001.8.21.14.30.40.203000.660978.IMA

     where fields (separated by dots) represent:
          MR   = modality
          2    = series number
          1    = image number
          2001 = year of acquisition
          8    = month
          21   = day
          14   = hour
          30   = min
          40   = sec
          203000    = time of transfer
          660978    = time of transfer
          (last 2 numbers are assigned at time of network transfer)

     We convert the all  of  these  names  to  a  5-digit  number
     representing  the  order  of  the  image  in the acquisition
     sequence, i.e, 00001.dcm.


DECIPHERING A DIRECTORY OF DICOM FILES
     If you recognize the file type from the name, you can view a
     summary  of all files using either pacscans (for PACS files)

     or mrscans  (for  MR  files).  If  you  have  no  clue,  use
     dcmscans.  All  3  of  these will save the summary in a file
     named Scans.lst (which is appended every time you run one of
     these  commands). If the file exists, just check it with cat
     or more. Note that MR studies will have an acquisition  type
     in  the  summary whereas CT studies will not.  CT scans with
     the different naming convention (see  above)  won't  display
     with pacscans; rename them and then get the list.

     The complete contents of any  DICOM  header  may  be  viewed
     using  the  command dcm_dump_file. The value of a particular
     element (specified by two 4-digit numbers)  is  saved  to  a
     file with dcm_dump_element.

     The  contents  of  CT  DICOM  headers  are  displayed   with
     dcm_ct2analyze.


WORKING WITH DICOM FILES
     The first step should be to archive the original files.

     Next, convert all filenames for one subject's  scan  session
     to the 5-digit format with the command dcm_rename.

     Then, determine if all file numbers for a given sequence are
     in  the  correct order. Use the command dcm_order to display
     the file number and slice  position  for  either  CT  or  MR
     images.

     Sometimes a CT data set will have a duplicate of some  table
     position.   One of the 2 files should be deleted. Since this
     leaves a gap in the sequence, use the command dcm_reorder to
     restore  a continuous sequence (this will rename some of the
     files).

     Sometimes a MR data set will have slices out  of  order.  In
     particular,  3D  TSE sequences are collected in 2 scans with
     multiple interleaving slabs. These must be arranged in order
     by copying all relevant files to a subdirectory, renumbering
     them with dcm_reorder (should the 2 sequences not  be  saved
     sequentially),  and then reordering this set by slice number
     using dcm_slice_reorder.

     After any reordering, check the new order with dcm_order.

     Finally, convert  each  sequence  (multiple  files)  to  the
     Analyze/IFH  format.  For MR images, use dcm2analyze; for CT
     images, use dcm_ct2analyze. Each conversion will specify the
     first  and  last numbers of the sequence. Three output files
     are created:  image data (.img), Analyze header (.hdr),  and
     Interfile header (.ifh).

     Last but not least, view the converted image with vidi look-
     ing  at each orientation. Check for proper orientation, con-
     tinuous slices, and artifacts. If something  is  missing  or
     there  are  prominent artifacts, the sooner it is caught the
     better.  Note that CT images that will be used  for  partial
     volume  correction are converted by dcm_ct2analyze using the
     "-n" flag. This disables  the  correction  for  gantry  tilt
     (thereby  preventing  interpolation)  but makes the sagittal
     views look distorted (especially if  there  was  substantial
     gantry tilt).
