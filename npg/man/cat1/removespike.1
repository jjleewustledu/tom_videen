NAME
     removespike - replace central pixel with mean of surrounding
     ones


SYNOPSIS
     removespike infile


DESCRIPTION
     removespike will replace an image  with  one  in  which  the
     value of central pixel of each slice (actually x=64,y=65) is
     replaced with the mean of its 8 surrounding pixels.

     This is a kludge to minimize the worst artifact caused by  a
     defective memory board on the 961 scanner from p5276-p5311.


EXAMPLE
     removespike p5276ho1.v
