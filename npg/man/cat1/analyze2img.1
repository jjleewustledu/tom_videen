NAME
     analyze2img - convert ANALYZE files to ECAT 7 format


SYNOPSIS
     analyze2img ANALYZE_root ECAT_filename [stdimg frm#]


DESCRIPTION
     Converts 8-bit or 16-bit Analyze files.

     Only the rootname for the input Analyze file  is  specified.
     However,  the complete output ECAT filename (with extension)
     should be used.

     If a standard image and frame number (3rd  and  4th  parame-
     ters)  are  specified, the output ECAT file will contain the
     header information from the standard image. This  is  neces-
     sary  if  frame start time and duration are important as the
     Analyze file contains none of this information.

     analyze2img reads a pair of  Analyze hdr and img  files  and
     creates  an ECAT 7.0 image file.  Images will be re-oriented
     so that right brain is on the right and slice 1 is  the  top
     of  brain.   The  output  image will be padded or clipped so
     that the slices are 128x128.  The number of slices will  not
     be altered.

     Effectively, running  img2analyze  followed  by  analyze2img
     should restore the original image in ECAT version 7.0 format
     with much of the header information missing, unless a  stan-
     dard image is used to read the info.
