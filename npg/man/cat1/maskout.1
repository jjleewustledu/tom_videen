NAME
     maskout - set to value all pixels NOT >= min AND <= max


SYNOPSIS
     maskout input output min max setval x y z [x2 y2 z2] ...


PARAMETERS
     input  - filename of input image
     output - filename of output image
     min    - mask above this intensity
     max    - mask below this intensity
     setval - value to assign to masked pixels
     x,y,z  - coordinates of one pixel within the object
     x2,y2,z2 - coordinates of a second pixel (up to 5 pixels)


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads an ANALYZE image and determines all  pix-
     els  which  have values both >= min AND <= max and which are
     connected to  the  seed  pixel(s).   Then,  all  pixels  NOT
     included in this subset are set to the specified value while
     all pixel values within the subset are preserved.  (Compared
     to maskand, this performs a logical nand operation).

     The search for connected pixels starts with the plane of the
     pixel and goes down (increasing plane number) until the last
     slice and then reverses and goes back up through all  slices
     searching  for  any  connected  pixels  to any of the pixels
     identified thus far. If any  pixels  are  added  in  a  loop
     through  the  slices,  the  program  runs through all slices
     again.

     During each iteration, the plane number (z) and total pixels
     within the object for that plane are displayed for planes in
     which at least one pixel has been included.

     This masked image is written to the output file  in  ANALYZE
     format.


EXAMPLES
     maskout p5000seg1 p5000seg2 -100 20 0 290 290 20
     maskout p5000seg1 p5000seg2 -100 20 0 290 290 20 300 320 29
