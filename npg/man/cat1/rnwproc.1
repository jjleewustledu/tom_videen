NAME
     rnwproc -compute reduced-noise estimate of randoms.


SYNOPSIS
     rnwproc -rtd -f framenumber inputfile.scn


DESCRIPTION
     Reads an ECAT sinogram file with prompts and delayeds stored
     separately and creates various output files:

          -r   corrected trues = prompts - reduced-noise delayeds
          -t   CTI trues = prompts - delayeds
          -d   prompts and reduced-noised delayeds
               (e.g., input for ML reconstruction)
          -f   process specified frame and store data in frame 1
               (without -f, all frames are processed)

     The algorithm is from  "Quantitation  in  Positron  Emission
     Computed   Tomography:   A  Technique  to  Reduce  Noise  in
     Accidental Coincidence Measurements  and  Coincidence  Effi-
     ciency  Calibration"  Michael E. Casey and Edward J. Hoffman
     (1986) Journal of Computer  Assisted  Tomography  10(5):845-
     850.

     Versions of  the  program  run  before  Feb  3,  1994,  were
     incorrect.

     NOTE:  with the current version, you must use "-rt"  if  you
     want "-t".
