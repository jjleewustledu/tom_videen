MASKTRANS(1)              User Commands              MASKTRANS(1)



NAME
     masktrans - mask a transmission image to 'brain'


SYNOPSIS
     masktrans filename


DESCRIPTION
     This script calls 3 programs: (1)  maskbars  to  remove  the
     headholder  bars from a transmission image; (2) maskpctslice
     to threshold the image to 60% of  each  slice  maximum;  (3)
     maskshrink  to strip 2 pixels off all edges of the remaining
     image.  The resulting image has thresholded dimensions which
     approximately correspond to the brain.

     The output image is intended as input to xray where  a  trim
     of  0  should be specified and which will effectively remove
     another 0.5 pixel from all edges of the brain.  xray  should
     be called using a threshold of 60 (actually anything between
     1-60 should be equivalent), peaktype of 1  and  trim  of  0.
     This  dimension  corresponds fairly well to that of a set of
     MR brain dimensions measured near the AC-PC plane.

     The output image file will have the same format as the input
     file (e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
