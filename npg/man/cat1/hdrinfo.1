DESCRIPTION

     file.  HDR  files  are created by metproc and petproc.  They
     contain factors which allow other  programs  (such  as  spi-
     deram)  to  convert  PET pixel values to metabolic or tissue
     activity. The HDR information can be redirected  to  a  disk
     file.

     The file extension, ".hdr", is optional. It the extension is
     not specified or specified worong, the program will automat-
     ically add the file extension.

     or, to write the information to a file
     hdrinfo p2000oo1 > output_file

           4 = blood flow (CBF)
