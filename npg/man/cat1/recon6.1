NAME
     recon6 - Reconstruct PETT VI images


DESCRIPTION
     There are a set of programs which will reconstruct  PETT  VI
     images  on  any  of the Suns. For a typical triple pack, the
     data set should include:
          r555nrm
          r555trn
          r555ho1
          r555oo1
          r555oc1

     These would be processed using the commands:
          pronorm6 r555nrm tov
          protran6 r555trn p555tr1 filterg tov
          recon6   r555ho1 p555ho1 filterg tov
          recon6   r555oo1 p555oo1 filterg tov
          recon6   r555oc1 p555oc1 filterg tov
          cleanid6 tov
