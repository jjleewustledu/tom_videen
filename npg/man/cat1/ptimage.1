NAME
     ptimage - create a paired-t image


SYNOPSIS
     ptimage difimage sedimage nimage timage
     where:
          difimage - a mean difference image (meandiff)
          sedimage - the corresponding image of pixel standard error of the difference (sed)
          nimage   - number of subjects contributing to each pixel (n)
          timage   - paired t image (t)


DESCRIPTION
     ptimage reads 3 image files and combines them to  create  an
     image  of pixel t-values.  All output t-values are scaled by
     1000 (i.e., divide by 1000 to get actual t).  A rec file  is
     created with the output file.

     Complete filenames should be  specified  for  all  4  files.
     Unlike  the  older version of ptimage, there are no restric-
     tions on the names of the 4 files.


ALGORITHM
          t = 1000 * meandiff / (sed / sqrt(n))

     where the files are defined as above.  Computations are done
     pixel-by-pixel.  If n <= 0 or sed <= 0, then t is set to 0.
