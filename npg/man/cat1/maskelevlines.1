NAME
     maskelevlines - set to specified value any pixel  between  2
     pixels whose values are less than oldval1 and oldval2


SYNOPSIS
     maskelevlines input output oldval1  oldval2  newval  [width]
     [range]


PARAMETERS
     input   - filename of input image
     output  - filename of output image
     oldval1 - maximum on one side of line
     oldval2 - maximum on other side of line
     setval  - value to assign to masked pixels
     width   - width of lines to remove
     range   - range of slices to mask


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads an ANALYZE image and sets all pixels to a
     specified  value  which  are between two pixels whose values
     are less than oldval1 and oldval2.  All other  pixel  values
     will be preserved.

     This masked object image is written to the  output  file  in
     ANALYZE format.

     The original intent was to  mask  out  elevated  (intensity)
     lines  in an image. Specifically, when the skull is stripped
     from a CT image, there remains a line of pixels  surrounding
     brain  which  has  intensities  in the gray matter range but
     which is due to volume averaging of the skull and  CSF.  For
     some  images, a single-pixel line is insufficient due to the
     beam-hardening artifact. For these images, mask  first  with
     the  default  width  of  1.  Then mask a second time using a
     width of 2 but restricting this mask  to  those  slices  for
     which  it  is  necessary  (upper  half  of brain); for lower
     slices it will remove too much!


EXAMPLE
     maskelevlines p5000ct_n p5000seg1_n -2000 20 -2000
     maskelevlines p5000ct_n p5000seg1_n -2000 20 -2000 2 1to30
