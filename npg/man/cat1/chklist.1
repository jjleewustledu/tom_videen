CHKLIST(1)                User Commands                CHKLIST(1)



NAME
     chklist - Check the existence of PET image and sxr files


SYNOPSIS
     chklist prmfile lstfile


DESCRIPTION
     chklist generates the list of full filenames from a  parame-
     ter  file  and image list and check that the files exist. If
     they do, it returns the complete path and filenames; if not,
     it returns an error message.

     The program returns a status value of 0 if  all  files  were
     found and a value of 255 if 1 or more files were not found.

     The program searches 4 locations in the following order:
          1) datapath (if defined in parameter file)
          2) local directory
          3) /tmp
