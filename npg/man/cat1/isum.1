NAME
     isum - sum images read from an imagelist

SYNOPSIS
     isum prm lst filename


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads multiple PET images and  sums  them.   It
     does  not  scale by the number of images (use imean for that
     function).  It will normalize all images (if  the  imagelist
     means  and  the "smg_norm" are not the same value).  It will
     perform subtractions for difference images  (if  specified).
     It will process PET images as metabolic images and create an
     hdr file (if specified).

     Output images will be in the same format as the input  file.
     Pixel dimensions are not changed from the input images.

     The following keywords are read from the  prm  file.   Files
     can be located in the local directory, a specified directory
     'datapath', or /tmp.  Examples are given for each parameter,
     but  all  allowed values are given only for those parameters
     unique to isum.

     # Required parameters for defining input filenames:

     species:        p
     tracer:         ho
     extension:      v
     imgfilter:      butterworth 0.5 5

     # Parameters required to find an image filename in the archive (when
     this feature is implemented):

     scanner:        961
     acquisition:    3d
     reconstruction: filtered_backprojection
     recfilter:      ramp

     # Optional parameters defining the image filename:

     datapath:
     suffix:

     # Required parameters for isum processing:

     smg_norm:         1000      # (any real number > 0)
     smg_mode:         single    # paired, diff

     # Optional parameter for isum:

     processing:       none      # cbf, cbv, oef, cmro2

     If the parameter "datapath" is specified, that will  be  the
     first  location  searched  for all input files.  Files which
     are created (smg, rec, etc.) will all appear in  your  local
     directory).
