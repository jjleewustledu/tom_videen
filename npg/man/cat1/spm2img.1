NAME
     spm2img - convert SPM image files to ECAT 7 format


SYNOPSIS
     spm2img SPM_file ECAT_file [stdimg frm#]


DESCRIPTION
     Converts 8-bit or 16-bit SPM files.

     Only the rootname for the input SPM file is specified.  How-
     ever,  the  complete  output  ECAT filename (with extension)
     should be used.

     If a standard image and frame number (3rd  and  4th  parame-
     ters)  are  specified, the output ECAT file will contain the
     header information from the standard image. This  is  neces-
     sary  if  frame start time and duration are important as the
     Analyze file contains none of this information.

     spm2img reads a pair of SPM hdr and img files and creates an
     ECAT  7.0  image  file.   Images  will be reoriented so that
     slice 1 is at the top of the brain.  The right/left orienta-
     tion  of SPM is maintained (right brain on the right).  This
     differs  from  the  behavior  of  analyze2img  which   flips
     right/left  to  place  right  brain  on  the right. (SPM and
     ANALYZE use the same format but have different conventions).

     The output image will be  padded  or  clipped  so  that  the
     slices  are  128x128.   The  number  of  slices  will not be
     altered.  If the SPM image has an odd number  of  voxels  in
     the  x-dimension,  the  extra  padding  voxel will be on the
     right side of the head.  For an odd number of voxels in  the
     y-dimension,  the  extra  padding voxel will be posterior to
     the head.
