NAME
     t88mean - transform PETT VI or ECAT  images  into  Talairach
     1988 atlas space.

SYNOPSIS
     t88mean prm imglst output.t88


DESCRIPTION
     This program converts PET images into atlas images based on:

     Talairach, J. & Tournoux, P.  (1988)  Co-planar  stereotaxic
     atlas of the human brain. New York: Thieme.

     The following keywords are read from the  prm  file.   Files
     can be located in the local directory, a specified directory
     'datapath', /tmp, or the archive.  Examples  are  given  for
     each  parameter,  but  all allowed values are given only for
     those parameters unique to t88mean.

                                   transformation matrix is determined; if "no", then
                                   the 5 required parameters become optional.

     The  imagelist  file  should  contain  normalization  values
     unless  the  images  are "dif" images (in which case t88mean
     always ignores the normalization values and assumes they are
     already normalized to 1000).

     For dif images,  there  must  be  corresponding  msk  images
     (smg_mask:  yes)  in order for t88mean in order to eliminate
     ambiguity about pixels whose values are zero.

     The optional parameters pixel_size and plane_separation will
     force  these  to be used as the dimensions of all PET images
     which are read.  These are necessary to process  953  images
     which have been converted to PETT VI format (e.g., with dif-
     gen).  Normally, if t88mean reads an image and finds  it  in
     PETT  VI format, it uses the standard dimensions of 0.286 cm
     pixels and 1.44 cm slice separation (there are no dimensions
     in PETT VI headers).

     Smg_included has 3 options.  "all" specifies that all pixels
     will  be  included  in the output image. "sampled" specifies
     that only fully sampled  pixels  (all  subjects  contribute)
     will  be included in the output image. "n=10" specifies that
     the output image will only have  non-zero  pixels  where  at
     least 10 subjects contributed to the pixel; furthermore, the
     option "smg_included: n=10" is specified, the  divisor  will
     always be local regardless of what is named for smg_divisor.

     Note that "smg_included: n=10" will include only those  pix-
     els  for which total weight >= 10.  If the weighting factors
     are all 1.0 or if no weighting factors appear in  the  image
     list,  then  this  is the same as including all pixels which
     were sampled by at least 10 scans.

     Smg_divisor has 3 options:

     global - divide the output image by the total weights
        for the entire input list (global max).

     local  - divide the output image by the total weight
        contributing to each pixel (local max).

     none   - do not divide the output image.
        This allows, say, a weight of .25 to produce a "t88sing"
        output image which is normalized to 250 instead of 1000.

     Note that weights are always relative to  the  rest  of  the
     list.   If you have 10 scans and assign them all a weight of
     0.5, t88mean  will  compute  the  same  image  as  would  be
     obtained  if all the weights were 1.0 (assuming that you are
     not masking by weights, i.e., that you  have  "smg_included:
     all").

     Smg_symmetry is working as of version 1.82 (20-Oct-93).   It
     will  perform  realignment  about  the  y-  and  z-axes  for
     smg_mode "single" or "paired  (but  not  "diff").  Selecting
     smg_symmetry causes the program to align the image to maxim-
     ize symmetry about the YZ-plane.  It is particularly  useful
     for images where the subject's head was rotated about either
     the y- or z-axis.  The effect is very noticeable in  indivi-
     dual  images,  but is less prominent when several images are
     averaged (for obvious reasons). The  smg_mskpct  applies  to
     the  image pixels to be used in maximimizing symmetry.  This
     should be left at 0 for now (using the entire  image)  until
     it is tested further.

     For ECAT image files, the  pixel_size  and  plane_separation
     are read from the file header.  For PETT VI format files, it
     is assumed that pixel_size = 0.286 cm and plane_separation =
     1.44  cm.  If these values are incorrect (which they will be
     if an ECAT image has been rewritten in PETT VI format, e.g.,
     difgen),  then  you  must  specify these two parameters with
     their proper values.  If you are uncertain about pixel size,
     run  ecathdr on one of your original images.  Typical values
     for ECAT images are:

          0.208621  (standard 2D ecat images zoomed 2.0)
          0.260777  (old 2D ecat images zoomed 1.5)
          0.208621  (standard 3D ecat images; or 2D images zoomed 1.875)

     The optional parameter "slices" will restrict the  range  of
     raw  PET  slices which will be included in the sampled image
     space.  For example, including the line

          slices:   6to26

     in your prm file (for ecat images) will cause  all  data  in
     slices 1-5 and 27-31 to be ignored by t88mean.  This differs
     from what you get if you simply mask the raw  images  before
     t88mean,  in  which case t88mean would interpret the data as
     sampled with zero activity.  It  is  the  same  as  using  a
     separate  msk  image  for each raw image in t88mean.  If the
     slices parameter is missing, then all slices  are  included.
     Note  that slices is applied to the input images and not the

     output image.

     If the parameter "datapath" is specified, that will  be  the
     first  location  searched  for all input files.  Files which
     are created (smg, rec, etc.) will still appear in you  local
     directory).

     See examples below for minimal prm files  for  some  typical
     data sets.


ALGORITHM
     The transformation requires an sxr file which  contains  the
     skull  y-  and  z-dimensions,  x-angle  or  rotation  of PET
     slices, the x-width  of  the  PET  slices,  and  information
     allowing the y- and z-translations to the atlas origin to be
     computed.  This  information  allows  6  parameters  of  the
     transformation to be computed.

     If smg_symmetry = yes in the prm file,  then  a  9-parameter
     transformation is used.  The y- and z-angles of rotation are
     computed by rotating the PET image around the  origin  until
     the  rms of pixel differences across the yz-plane are minim-
     ized (i.e., until symmetry is achieved).  The  x-translation
     is  computed  as  the  x  center-of-mass  of the aligned PET
     image.

     If smg_symmetry = no in the prm  file,  then  a  7-parameter
     transformation  is  used.  There is no correction for y- and
     z-rotation.  The x-translation is computed as the x  center-
     of-mass of the PET image.

     Scaling is performed along 3 perpendicular axes using:

     x scaler = width of PET slice (from sxr  file;  interpolated
     if necessary) / 13.0 cm

     y scaler = length of acpc line to inner table of skull (from
     sxr) / (17.2 + 1.0) cm

     z scaler = distance from acpc line to inner table  of  skull
     (from sxr) / 7.4 cm

     Note that 5 mm is added between brain and skull at front and
     back in these calculations.


     The atlas origin is 1.8 cm anterior to  the  center  of  the
     brain  along the acpc line.  In the output images, the atlas
     origin is in slice 31 with coordinates 64.5, 64.5, as it  is
     with hd6mean images.

     If smg_sdimage = yes, an  image  representing  the  unbiased
     estimate  of  standard deviation is computed and stored with
     the extension .sd.  For these images, each pixel is computed
     as:

       if (n > 1 and sumsqrs > 0) then
         pixel = sqrt ((sumsqrs - ((sum * sum) / n)) / (n - 1));
       else
         pixel = 0;

     where:

       n = number of individual scans (or scan pairs) contributing
           to each pixel;
       sum = sum of the pixel values (or pixel differences);
       sumsqrs = sum of the squares of the pixel values (or sum of
           the pixel differences squared);
       sqrt = square root operation;

     Therefore, the standard error of the mean (or standard error
     of  the  mean difference) would be computed by dividing each
     pixel in the sd image by sqrt(n).
