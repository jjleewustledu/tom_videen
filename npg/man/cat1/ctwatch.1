CTWATCH(1)                User Commands                CTWATCH(1)



NAME
     ctwatch - monitor CT scans; download specified scan


SYNOPSIS
     ctwatch [-s <searchstring>...] [-d <outdir>]


OPERANDS
OPTIONS
     -s <searchstring>: string(s) for locating a particular CT;
                        e.g., patient last name
     -d <outdir>: local directory for downloading files to


DESCRIPTION
     This script displays  CT  scan  information  as  scans  come
     online,  searches  for  a specified scan, and downloads this
     scan data after the specified scan is finished.  The  script
     must  be  run  from npggw, the DEC gateway (machine on which
     dni software is installed). It is  meant  to  run  for  long
     periods  of  time (hours, for instance) in its own shell, in
     order to watch for a given scan or scans for downloading.


EXAMPLES
NOTES
     Script attempts to print directory listing each time  a  new
     directory appears online. If error such as "Connection timed
     out" occurs on an attempt to print info.  for  a  particular
     dir., another attempt will be made to access and print info.
     for this dir. on the next go-round.  This  means  that  some
     dirs. may appear out of chronological order.
