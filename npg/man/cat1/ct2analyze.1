NAME
     ct2analyze - convert CT from SSPLUS to  Analyze  format  and
     create Interfile header


SYNOPSIS
     ct2analyze firstfile lastfile outprefix [-n]


OPERANDS
     firstfile - first file number, e.g. "2" or "00002"
     lastfile  - last file number, e.g., "45" or "00045"
     outprefix - prefix for naming output file, e.g., "p5064"

     Note: Use ctheader to determine which slice(s) are  localiz-
     ers, as you will probably want to exclude these.


OPTIONS
     -n: Do not reorient slices (do not correct for gantry tilt)

     Note: If this option is chosen, no row-shifting and interpo-
     lation will occur within slices, and the output header value
     for slice separation (zpix) will not be corrected either. In
     sagittal  view,  head will look stretched from front to back
     and compressed from top to bottom. In coronal view, head may
     appear normal from side to side, but will be compressed from
     top to bottom. How  misshapen  the  head  will  appear  will
     depend  on the gantry tilt, which has been between 0 and -25
     degrees for the SSPLUS scans we have seen.

DESCRIPTION
     This program reads multiple, sequential  CT  images  of  the
     Siemens  Somatom  Plus file format. Filenames are assumed to
     have extension "ima" and to contain exactly  5  digits,  and
     only 5 digits, not including the extension, e.g., 00001.ima,
     00002.ima, 00003.ima,..., 00042.ima. Only the integer values
     of  the  first and last file need to be specified, e.g., "1"
     and "42". Leading zeros will be prepended.

     Pixel values
     ------------
     Pixel maximum and  minimum  values  in  output  headers  are
     empirical,  and  tend  to  be 0 for the minimum and approxi-
     mately 2700 for the maximum. The pixel max and  min  can  be
     edited  in  Analyze  by  selecting the Header Edit option. A
     range of approximately 1000 - 1100 seems to  work  well  for
     viewing  the brain. The average pixel value for the skull is
     approximately 1800.

NOTES
     Siemens Somatom Plus File Format
     --------------------------------
     We have examined Siemens Somatom Plus CT files from the fol-
     lowing  time  period: Nov., 1993 through the present (April,
     1996). The file size and format appears to  have  been  con-
     sistent  during this time period, but we don't know for sure
     that it was the same before this time  period,  or  that  it
     will  remain  the same. Currently (April, 1996), the Siemens
     Somatom Plus image files are 528384 bytes in size. The first
     4096  bytes  contain  the  header,  and the following 524288
     bytes contain the image (pixel) data.

     Corrections for Gantry Tilt
     ---------------------------
     The gantry of the SSPLUS CT scanner has a tilt range of  -25
     to  +25  degrees.  For the brain scans we have examined, the
     tilt range has been between 0 and -25 degrees.


                  patient          |  /-25 degree tilt
             feet         head __  | /
             *****************(__) |/
           ________________________/_________scanner bed
                                  /|
                                 / |
                                /  | 0 degree tilt


     slice separation:
        slice separation = (table increment) x cos(abs(tilt))
        e.g., if the table moves 3 mm between slices:
        (3.0 mm) x cos(25 degrees) = 2.718 mm separation

     AP shift for a given slice (0..end):
        shift in mm = slice# x (table increment) x sin(-tilt)
        A positive shift means slices are shifted posteriorly.
        e.g., for the second slice:
        1 x (3.0 mm) x sin(25 degrees) = 1.2 mm shift
