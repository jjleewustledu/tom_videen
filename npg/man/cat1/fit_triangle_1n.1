NAME
     fit_triangle_1n - reads  6  Analyze  images  containing  the
     branches  of  1  triangle  and 1 fiducial N and computes the
     coordinates of the intersections of the branches


SYNOPSIS
     fit_triangle_1n


DESCRIPTION
     This program requests the rootname for  a  set  of  6  files
     which contain the branches of 1 fiducial triangle and 1 N on
     the monkey chair use for PET and MR studies.   The  rootname
     may be anything, but the program expects the filenames to be
     the following (where the root is "mr8"):

     mr8lftriback.img
     mr8lftridiag.img
     mr8lftritop.img
     mr8backndiag.img
     mr8backnlf.img
     mr8backnrt.img

     The program uses linear regression to fit  lines  to  points
     defining each of the fiducials.  Each fiducial is assumed to
     be in a plane, but there are no constraints on the angles or
     distances between any of the branches.

     Either 8- or 16-bit images may be read (but not both in  one
     run).  The program runs under IDL.


OUTPUT
     Program output is to a file <rootname>.fid which  will  con-
     tain  the  coordinates  of  the 6 points of intersection (in
     mm).  Example:

           136.009    0.0363569      31.2111      Z: diagonal+left
           33.0497    -0.717107      100.128      Z: diagonal+right
           177.892      11.7376      86.7079      Triangle: back+top
           175.320      99.9721      80.2110      Triangle: diagonal+top
           169.519      5.60356     -1.79455      Triangle: diagonal+back
