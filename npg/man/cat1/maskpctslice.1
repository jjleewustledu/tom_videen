NAME
     maskpctslice - mask an image by thresholding each slice


SYNOPSIS
     maskpctslice input output threshold


PARAMETERS
     input     - input filename
     output    - output filename
     threshold - percent of slice maximum


DESCRIPTION
     This program creates a thresholded image by zeroing all pix-
     els  beyond  an  external  boundary for which all pixels are
     greater than or equal to the threshold as  applied  to  each
     individual slice.

     maskpctslice differs from maskpct in  two  respects:  First,
     the  absolute  threshold  is, in general, different for each
     slice with maskpctslice  (maskpct  uses  the  same  absolute
     threshold  for  all slices).  Second, the portions of output
     image which are not zero contain the  pixel  values  of  the
     input image with maskpctslice (maskpct sets them all to 1).

     The output image file will have the same format as the input
     file (e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
