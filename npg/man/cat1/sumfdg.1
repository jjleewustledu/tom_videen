NAME
     sumfdg - creates a composite fdg image

SYNOPSIS
     sumfdg filename


DESCRIPTION
     Sumfdg adds the last 9 frames of a dynamic  fdg  image.   It
     assumes  the  input file name is of the form "p2000fdg1.img"
     and creates a file without the "1", i.e., "p2000fdg.img".

     The input file must have at  least  9  frames  (the  current
     standard  acquisitions produce fdg images of either 9 frames
     (using scanFDGnondyn) or 43 frames (using scanFDG)).

     The output image will have 1 frame, which is  renumbered  as
     frame 1.  The output image is scaled by 0.1.

     The frame duration is summed for all input frames.
