NAME
     makebmap - generate a map file containing a linear transfor-
     mation matrix for baboon brains


SYNOPSIS
     makebmap mapfile airfile X Y Z xdim ydim zdim


DESCRIPTION
     This program creates a transformation  matrix  for  t88trans
     (corresponding  to  the Davis & Huffman 1968 baboon atlas or
     'dh68') using:

     an air file generated  by  the  AIR  program  alignpettomri,
     alignpettomri16  or  alignlinear.  The MR image to which the
     PET is aligned must first be oriented such that  its  planes
     are parallel to the AC-PC plane.

     X, Y, Z are the pixel coordinates of CENTER of the  anterior
     commissure  taken  from  the  MR  image  to which the PET is
     aligned.

     xdim, ydim, zdim are the brain dimensions in mm measured  in
     the  MR image.  xdim is the right-left interputamen distance
     on the coronal slice containing the center of  the  anterior
     commissure;  ydim  is the distance from the center of the AC
     to the top edge of the PC; zdim is the average  (of  left  &
     right)  vertical  distance  between  the  top of the caudate
     nucleus and the bottom of the optic tract,  on  the  coronal
     slice containing the center of the AC.

     The t88 transformation uses atlas brain dimensions of:
          xdim = 19.5 mm
          ydim = 14.5 mm
          zdim = 23.2 mm

     and places the atlas origin at (counting from 1):
          X = 64.5 (middle of a 128 array)
          Y = 64.5 (middle of a 128 array)
          Z = 43   (default unless another z0 is specified)

     Note that the atlas origin is 7.0 mm inferior  and  21.0  mm
     posterior  to the anterior commissure in the Davis & Huffman
     1968 atlas.


COORDINATES
     The coordinates for 'Origins' which appear while makebmap is
     running  now  should correspond exactly to the pixel coordi-
     nates which are used by either Analyze or  spideram.   These
     are:

     Origin defined in Spideram space of atlas image
     Origin defined in ANALYZE space of MR image
     Origin aligned in ANALYZE space of input PET image
     Origin aligned in Spideram space of input PET image

     Analyze and spideram differ as follows (using a 31-slice PET
     image  with  128x128  pixels per plane):  The center of this
     image in both spideram  and  Analyze  is  [64.5,64.5,16]  --
     [x,y,z].  The  left,  anterior, superior corner of the image
     (relative  to  subject)   is   [1,1,1]   in   spideram   and
     [128,128,31] in Analyze (Region of Interest and Oblique Sec-
     tions).
