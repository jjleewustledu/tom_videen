NAME
     tsei2analyze - Converts a set of Siemens Turbo Spin Echo  MR
     image  files  to Analyze and Interfile format (img, hdr, and
     ifh)


SYNOPSIS
     tsei2analyze <root1> <seq1> <seq2> <Analyze root>


DESCRIPTION
     tsei2analyze is intended to convert a pair of TSE  sequences
     acquired  as  interleaved  slices.  To convert a pair of TSE
     sequences acquired as sets of offset slabs, use tse2analyze.

     tsei2analyze reads  multiple,  sequential  MR  image  files,
     reorients  them  to the 3-D ordering expected by Analyze and
     writes a single image file comprising  all  slices  plus  an
     Analyze  hdr  file  and an Interfile Format header file.  It
     does not change the input  data  except  for  reorientation;
     specifically,  it  does  not  generate  voxels with uniform,
     cubic dimensions.

     The extension "ima" is  assumed  for  all  MR  image  files.
     Turbo  Spin  Echo sequences generate 2 sets of Siemens files
     with separate root names. The slices are interleaved between
     the  two root files.  Tsei2analyze sorts these out in creat-
     ing a single composite volume.

     The extensions "img", "hdr", and "ifh" are used  for  output
     files.

     The Analyze orientation will match  labels  within  Analyze.
     Note  that  Analyze  thinks  in radiological orientation and
     displays right-on-left (viewing the body from the feet).


NOTES ON ORIENTATION
     While this program is intended to produce output in  a  con-
     sistent  orientation (with transverse sections), it has only
     been tested with MR images  in  View_LtoR  (sagittal).   All
     bets are off for other orientations.


STACKING ORDER
     If the slabs appear out of order, reverse the entry of first
     and  second sequences on the command line (as in the example
     below).
