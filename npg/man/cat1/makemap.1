NAME
     makemap - generate a map file containing a linear  transfor-
     mation matrix for t88trans or t88trsing


SYNOPSIS
     makemap mapfile airfile X Y Z xdim ydim zdim


DESCRIPTION
     This program creates a transformation  matrix  for  t88trans
     using:

     an air file generated by the AIR  program  alignpettomri  or
     alignpettomri16.   The  MR image to which the PET is aligned
     must first be oriented such that its planes are parallel  to
     the AC-PC plane.

     X, Y, Z are the pixel coordinates of the 1988 Talairach ori-
     gin  (the  superior,  posterior edge of the anterior commis-
     sure) taken from the MR image to which the PET is aligned.

     xdim, ydim, zdim are the brain dimensions (in pixels)  meas-
     ured  in  the  MR  image.   xdim is the right-left dimension
     (pixels) of the brain  in  the  ACPC  plane.   ydim  is  the
     anterior-posterior  dimension  (pixels)  of the brain in the
     ACPC plane.  zdim is the distance  (planes)  from  the  ACPC
     plane to the top of the brain (the greatest distance, which,
     in general, is not measured from the anterior commissure).

     The t88 transformation uses atlas brain dimensions of:
          xdim = 135 mm
          ydim = 172 mm
          zdim =  74 mm

     and places the atlas origin at (counting from 1):
          X = 64.5 (middle of a 128 array)
          Y = 64.5 (middle of a 128 array)
          Z = 31   (default unless another z0 is specified)


COORDINATES
     The coordinates for 'Origins' which appear while makebmap is
     running  now  should correspond exactly to the pixel coordi-
     nates which are used by either Analyze or  spideram.   These
     are:

     Origin defined in Spideram space of atlas image
     Origin defined in ANALYZE space of MR image
     Origin aligned in ANALYZE space of input PET image
     Origin aligned in Spideram space of input PET image

     Analyze and spideram differ as follows (using a 47-slice PET
     image  with  128x128  pixels per plane):  The center of this
     image in both spideram  and  Analyze  is  [64.5,64.5,24]  --
     [x,y,z].  The  left,  anterior, superior corner of the image
     (relative  to  subject)   is   [1,1,1]   in   spideram   and
     [128,128,47] in Analyze (Region of Interest and Oblique Sec-
     tions).
