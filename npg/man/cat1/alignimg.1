NAME
     alignimg - align all images in an imagelist to  a  specified
     standard


SYNOPSIS
     alignimg prm imglist -s<num> -u -r -m <mask>


DESCRIPTION
     This program aligns all images in an imagelist to a standard
     image.  That  is,  it  creates  an AIR file (*.air) for each
     image in the imagelist, using the AIR program alignlinear.

     The standard image must be  specified  on  the  command-line
     using  the  -s  flag.  Only the scan number should be speci-
     fied. For example, if the ho2 scan will be used as the stan-
     dard, "-s2" should be typed.

     If the optional -u flag is used, then unidirectional  align-
     ment is performed to the standard image (default is bidirec-
     tional). This should be used when the standard  image  is  a
     resliced  image  which  has  zeros  in slices which were not
     zeros in the original.

     If the optional -r flag is used, then  ratios  are  computed
     for  the cost function (default is to use least squares with
     intensity scaling, which is preferable for similar images).

     If the optional -m flag is used followed by the name  of  an
     image file in Analyze format, then this mask will be applied
     in both directions of the alignment.  (default is no mask).

     AIR files are named as follows:
          <species><subject id><tracer><scan no.>.air
     e.g., p5432ho1.air

     If an AIR file does not exist  for  a  given  image,  it  is
     created  in  the  local  directory.  If  an AIR file (*.air)
     already exists for a given image (using  the  naming  scheme
     above),  the  program  prints an error message and continues
     processing the rest of the list. Existing AIR files are  not
     overwritten.

     Alignimg will search for specified images (for the  standard
     image  specified  on  the  command  line, and for all of the
     images specified in the imagelist) in the  following  places
     and in the following order:
      - datapath (if defined in the parameter file)
      - the local directory
      - the image archive

     If a specified image (standard or reslice) cannot be  found,
     the program prints an error message and continues processing
     the rest of the list.

     Thresholds for the standard and reslice images can be speci-
     fied  in  the  parameter file using the parameters "t1:" and
     "t2:", which are specific to alignimg. "t1:"  is the  thres-
     hold  that will be used for the standard image during align-
     ment. "t2:" is the threshold  that  will  be  used  for  the
     reslice image. If t1 and t2 are not specified in the parame-
     ter file, default values of 400.0 will be used for  both  t1
     and t2.


SAMPLE PARAMETER FILE
     The following parameters are recognized by alignimg:

     t1: 312.0        # threshold for alignment - standard image
     t2: 217          # threshold for alignment - reslice image


EXAMPLES
     alignimg my.prm my.lst -s2
     alignimg my.prm my.lst -s2 -u
     alignimg my.prm my.lst -s2 -u -r
     alignimg my.prm my.lst -s2 -m mask.img
