     _g_i_n ] [ -b_b_o_r_d_e_r ] [ -d_l_w_i_d_t_h ] [ -s_s_c_a_l_e ] [ -_n_u_p ] [ -q  ]
     [ _i_n_f_i_l_e [ _o_u_t_f_i_l_e ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_s_n_u_p puts multiple logical pages onto each  physical  sheet
     of paper.  The input PostScript file should follow the Adobe
     Document Structuring Conventions.

     The -_w option gives the paper width, and the -_h option gives
     the  paper height, normally specified in cm or in to convert
     PostScript's points (1/72 of  an  inch)  to  centimeters  or
     inches.  The -_p option can be used as an alternative, to set
     the paper size to a3, a4, a5, b5, letter, legal,  or  10x14.
     The default paper size is a4. The -_W, -_H, and -_P options set
     the input paper size, if it is  different  from  the  output
     size.  This  makes  it easy to impose pages of one size on a
     different size of paper.

     The -_l  option  should  be  used  for  pages  which  are  in
     landscape  orientation  (rotated  90 degrees anticlockwise).
     The -_r option should be used for pages which are in seascape
     orientation  (rotated  90  degrees  clockwise),  and  the -_f
     option should be used for pages which  have  the  width  and
     height interchanged, but are not rotated.

     _P_s_n_u_p normally uses `row-major' layout, where adjacent pages
     are  placed in rows across the paper.  The -_c option changes
     the order to  `column-major',  where  successive  pages  are
     placed in columns down the paper.

     A margin to leave around the whole  page  can  be  specified
     with the -_m option. This is useful for sheets of `thumbnail'
     pages, because the normal page margins are reduced  by  put-
     ting multiple pages on a single sheet.

     The -_b option is used to specify an additional margin around
     each page on a sheet.

     The -_d option draws a line around the border of  each  page,
     of the specified width.  If the _l_w_i_d_t_h parameter is omitted,
     a default linewidth of 1 point is assumed. The linewidth  is
     relative  to the original page dimensions, _i._e. it is scaled
     down with the rest of the page.

     The scale chosen by _p_s_n_u_p can  be  overridden  with  the  -_s
     option.  This  is  useful  to  merge pages which are already

     reduced.

     The -_n_u_p option selects the number of logical pages  to  put
     on  each sheet of paper. This can be any whole number; _p_s_n_u_p
     tries to optimise the layout so that the minimum  amount  of
     space  is  wasted.  If _p_s_n_u_p cannot find a layout within its
     tolerance limit, it will abort with an  error  message.  The
     alternative  form  _i _n_u_p can also be used, for compatibility
     with other n-up programs.

     _P_s_n_u_p normally prints the page  numbers  of  the  pages  re-
     arranged; the -_q option suppresses this.

EXAMPLES
     The potential use of this utility is varied but one particu-
     lar use is in conjunction with _p_s_b_o_o_k(_1). For example, using
     groff to create a PostScript document and lpr  as  the  UNIX
     print spooler a typical command line might look like this:

     groff -Tps -ms _f_i_l_e | psbook | psnup -2 | lpr

     Where file is a 4 page document this command will result  in
     a  two page document printing two pages of _f_i_l_e per page and
     rearranges the page order to match the input pages 4  and  1
     on  the  first  output  page and pages 2 then 3 of the input
     document on the second output page.
