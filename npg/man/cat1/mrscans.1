NAME
     mrscans - identifies MR DICOM scans by series number


SYNOPSIS
     mrscans <MR | .MR>


DESCRIPTION
     mrscans reads all DICOM files in a directory, sorts them  by
     series number, then writes:

     1) first and last filenames in each series
     2) sequence filename and sequence description
     3) subject id, study date, orientation, image dimensions,
        and pixel dimensions

     This information is saved in a file Scans.lst.

     Input DICOM files use the naming convention:

          .MR..2.1.2001.8.21.14.30.40.203000.660978.IMA

     where fields (separated by dots) represent:
          MR   = modality
          2    = series number
          1    = image number
          2001 = year of acquisition
          8    = month
          21   = day
          14   = hour
          30   = min
          40   = sec
          203000 = time of transfer
          660978 = time of transfer
               (last 2 numbers are assigned at time of network transfer)

     Input files may have the initial dot removed, e.g.,
          MR..2.1.2001.8.21.14.30.40.203000.660978.IMA

     The script looks only a the initial character of the root.
     Files must begin with ".MR.." or "MR..".
