MASKIMG(1)                User Commands                MASKIMG(1)



NAME
     maskimg - mask one image using another


SYNOPSIS
     maskimg input mask output threshold


PARAMETERS
     input     - filename of image to be masked
     mask      - filename of the mask image (may be same as input)
     output    - filename of output image
     threshold - minimum pixel value to include
     setvalue  - optional value to assign to output pixels


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads 2 PET images and creates an output  image
     in  which every pixel is equal to that of the input image if
     it is greater than or equal to the  specified  threshold  in
     the  mask  image and zero if not.  0.0001 is subtracted from
     the specified  threshold  to  eliminate  potential  roundoff
     errors for real numbers.

     If a setvalue is specified the program performs a  different
     function  which  totally  ignores  the  input image. In this
     case, whenever the mask image pixel value is greater than or
     equal  to  the  specified  threshold, the output image pixel
     will have this value; all other pixels will be 0.

     The output image file will have the same format as the input
     file (e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
