NAME
     ising - create single normalized PETT VI or ECAT images


SYNOPSIS
     ising prm imagelist


DESCRIPTION
     This script normalizes a list of PET images or creates  sin-
     gle difference pairs from the list.

     ising separates an imagelist into single lists (using  /tmp)
     and  then  processes  these  lists to create a set of single
     images.  Processes either  filtered  or  unfiltered  images.
     Deletes all temporary files on /tmp.

     Imagelists and parameter lists are the same as those used by
     imean.   However,  imagelists MUST have each field separated
     by a SINGLE TAB and should not have any comment lines

     Output filenames are created using the parameter and imagel-
     ist files and are always given the extension .im.
