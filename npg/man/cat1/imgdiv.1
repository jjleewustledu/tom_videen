IMGDIV(1)                 User Commands                 IMGDIV(1)



NAME
     imgdiv - divide one image by another


SYNOPSIS
     imgdiv scan1,f1 scan2,f2 out

     where: out = (f1 * scan1) / (f2 * scan2)


DESCRIPTION
     This program divides a pair of PET images with scaling  fac-
     tors applied. Factors may be any real number. If the divisor
     is 0, the output pixel value will be 0.

     Note that if there are extreme values in the  outer  regions
     of  an  image,  the  entire  image  will  be scaled to those
     values.  To avoid this, mask the divisor image  before  cal-
     ling imgdiv.


EXAMPLES
     imgdiv p5000ho1.v p5000ho2.v p5000sum.v
     imgdiv p5000ho1.v,2 p5000ho2.v,-0.5 p5000sum.v
