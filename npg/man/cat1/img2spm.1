NAME
     img2spm - convert ECAT or PETT image files to ANALYZE format


SYNOPSIS
     img2spm <PET filename> <ANALYZE root>

     The complete PET filename must be specified,  but  only  the
     rootname  for  the Analyze file.  The program will automati-
     cally add the extensions  "img"  and  "hdr"  to  the  output
     files.


DESCRIPTION
     img2spm reads any PET image handled by our library  routines
     (PETT  VI  and  ECAT)  reorients  them  to  the 3-D ordering
     expected by SPM and creates 3 output  files:   img  and  hdr
     files  for SPM plus a color lookup table used for PET images
     in Analyze.

     The PET images are re-ordered so that slice 1  will  be  the
     bottom of the brain.

     This program differs from img2analyze in that the left-right
     orientation is reversed!

     If the PET image has the atlas z0  value  set  (see  setz0),
     then  img2spm  will set the atlas z-origin for SPM (equal to
     number of planes + 1 -  z0).   The  xy-origin  =  [64,  65].
     Information in the hdr file created by either img2spm or SPM
     may be viewed with spmhdr.


EXAMPLE
     img2spm p5000ho1.v ap5000ho1
