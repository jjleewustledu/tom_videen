NAME
     dcm_series_reorder - reorders DICOM scans by relative  image
     number


SYNOPSIS
     dcm_series_reorder first last


DESCRIPTION
     dcm_series_reorder renumbers the scans in the order in which
     they were originally acquired. It is useful to undo reorder-
     ing of TSE sequences after  they  have  been  combined  with
     dcm_slice_reorder.

     The filenames must be a  5  digit  number  followed  by  the
     extension .dcm; i.e., "00001.dcm".

     This perl script calls the program dcm_dump_element from the
     ERL DICOM package.


EXAMPLES
     dcm_series_reorder 1 299
