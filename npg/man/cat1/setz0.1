NAME
     setz0 - assigns the atlas z-origin to an ECAT image

SYNOPSIS
     setz0 filename plane


DESCRIPTION
     Setz0 adds a string to the comment field of the main  header
     of an ECAT image file to identify the z-origin of the image.

     The z-origin of an  image  may  be  seen  with  the  command
     imghdr.


EXAMPLE
     setz0 ctrl3d.t88 38

     This adds the string "z0:  38"  to  the  mainheader  comment
     field.   This  field is interpretted (and required) by other
     programs that display slices or  calculate  regional  values
     based  on  atlas  coordinates.  Vidi will only display atlas
     outlines if the header has a z-origin.
