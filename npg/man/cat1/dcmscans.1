NAME
     dcmscans - identifies DICOM scans by series number


SYNOPSIS
     dcmscans


DESCRIPTION
     dcmscans reads all DICOM files in a directory, sorts them by
     series number, then writes:

     1) first and last filenames in each series
     2) sequence filename and sequence description
     3) subject id, study date, orientation, image dimensions,
        and pixel dimensions

     This information will be save in a file Scans.lst.

     Input DICOM files must be named with a 5 digit  number  fol-
     lowed  by the extension .dcm; i.e., "00001.dcm". The program
     "dcm_rename" will convert DICOM filenames to names with this
     format.
