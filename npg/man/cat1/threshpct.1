NAME
     threshpct - create a mask image (with pixels = 0 or 1)


SYNOPSIS
     threshpct input output threshold [planes]


PARAMETERS
     input     - filename of image to be masked
     output    - filename of output image
     threshold - percent of maximum pixel count
     planes    - slices to mask


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads any PET image, searches for  the  maximum
     pixel  value  (using  the  range  of slices specified or all
     slices if not), and then masks all pixels of the input image
     which are less then the threshold in all planes.

     The output image file will have the same format as the input
     file (e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
