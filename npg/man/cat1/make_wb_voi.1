Name
     make_wb_voi - create whole-brain VOI file


SYNOPSIS
     make_wb_voi image slices threshold


DESCRIPTION
     This command script creates a VOI file that can be  used  by
     either vidi or vstat to compute whole-brain values.

     The input image is a brain tissue image created from a core-
     gistered,  segmented  MR  image.  All voxels greater than or
     equal to the specified threshold over the specified range of
     slices  are  included in the VOI.  Typically the slice range
     represents all planes below the sagittal sinus and above the
     transverse sinus (as determined from a CO-image).


EXAMPLE
