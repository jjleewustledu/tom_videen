NAME
     fixsino - This program changes the  bytes  in  sinograms  to
     remove artifacts caused by disk-to-tape write errors.


SYNOPSIS
     fixsino _s_c_n_f_i_l_e _m_a_t_r_i_x [-_h]


DESCRIPTION
     fixsino  gives the user a histogram of the sinogram file. It
     asks  the  user  for  a cutoff value ( > 0). Any pixel value
     with the absolute pixel value greater than or equal  to  the
     cutoff value is set to the average of its eight neighbors.


PARAMETERS
      _s_c_n_f_i_l_e:   sinogram file name.
      _m_a_t_r_i_x:    matrix = frame,plane,gate,data_type,bed. The
                 full matrix should be specified. The parameters
                 gate, data type, and bed are required. For
                 example, 2,221,1,0,0 is a valid specification,
                 while 2,221 is not.
      -_h:        Optional parameter to generate histogram data
                 only. The original sinogram file is not changed
                 if this parameter is specified.


EXAMPLES
     fixsino p2498ho8.scn 2,221,1,0,0
     fixsino p2498ho8.scn 2,221,1,0,0 -h
