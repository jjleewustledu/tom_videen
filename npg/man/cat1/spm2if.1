NAME
     spm2if - create Interfile header for an SPM image


SYNOPSIS
     spm2if SPM_file


DESCRIPTION
     Creates an .ifh file in Interfile format for an SPM image in
     Analyze  format.  The  reason  for  doing this is to add the
     atlas origin to  the  header,  thereby  permitting  vidi  to
     display SPM T-images with atlas tracings superimposed.

     The program makes the following assumptions:

     1) the atlas origin lies at the center of the image matrix;

     2) the pixel order is:
          matrix initial element [1] := left
          matrix initial element [2] := posterior
          matrix initial element [3] := inferior

     If either of these assumptions is wrong, you must  edit  the
     .ifh file to correct the error.
