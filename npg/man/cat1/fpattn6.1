NAME
     fpattn6 - forward project 953B attenuation correction


SYNOPSIS
     fpattn6 attn_image.img old_attn.atn new_attn.atn


DESCRIPTION
     fpattn6 forward projects a transmission image and creates an
     attenuation  file.  This new attenuation file can be used to
     to re-reconstruct emission sinograms from a study.

     An old attenuation file  is  used  to  extract  file  header
     information.

     The utility of fpattn6 is in reconstructing all images of  a
     subject  using  a  common  attenuation  correction. When two
     transmission  scans  were  collected,  these  can  be  core-
     gistered,  averaged, forward-projected, and the average used
     to reconstruct all sinograms for the subject.

     The attenuation correction can be coregistered to each emis-
     sion  scan  using  the  alignment  matrix (air file) for the
     emission images.  By doing this, a difference image  created
     from coregistered emission images will not have noise due to
     the attenuation correction.


NOTES
     Always forward-project to  a  stationary  attenuation  file.
     Then,  if  needed,  use  makeWobbleAttn  to create a wobbled
     attenuation file.

     Comparisons between images reconstructed  with  and  without
     forward-projected  attenuation files suggests that the pixel
     size in 953B image headers is inaccurate. My  best  estimate
     is  that  the  size should be multiplied by 1.014. As of Feb
     2002, this scaling is applied within fpattn6 and the  origi-
     nal pixel sizes are unchanged in the image headers.

     There are tradeoffs between fineness  of  interpolation  and
     processing  speed, and I have chosen a middle path that uses
     sufficient interpolation within  fpattn6  to  give  artifact
     free results most of the time. However, there is a possibil-
     ity of getting a hot pixel in the attenuation file  (readily
     seen  with  sino) that will be propagated as a streak in the
     images if certain zooms are used on the  transmission  image
     (in  particular, 1.825 and 2.0). Most zooms work fine (e.g.,
     1.5, 1.7, 1.875, 1.9 are a few that have been tested). These
     zooms  are only restrictions for the transmission image; you
     can use any  zoom  on  the  emission  images!   Since  1.875

     appears to be the standard zoom in transmission images, this
     is probably irrelevant.
