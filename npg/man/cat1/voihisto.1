NAME
     voihisto - plot histogram of a voi in an image


SYNOPSIS
     voihisto imagefile voifile voiname


DESCRIPTION
     This program plots pixel intensity histograms of any  single
     VOI on a particular histogram. It also computes the midpoint
     of the distribution using the midpoint at half-maximum.

     The program was originally compiled  to  estimate  mean  CSF
     intensity from a liberally thresholded VOI on the ventricles
     of an MPRAGE image.


EXAMPLE
     voihisto p5067mpr2.img p5067mpr2.voi csf


SEE ALSO
     voihistos(1)


NOTES
     The program requires an IDL license.
