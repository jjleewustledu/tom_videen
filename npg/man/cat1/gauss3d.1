NAME
     gauss3d - 3D Gaussian filter using IDL


SYNOPSIS
     gauss3d infile [outfile] half_freq


DESCRIPTION
     gauss3d filters images in the following formats: CTI  ver  6
     or  7  (ECAT  953B  and 961), Interfile format, Analyze, and
     PETT VI.  It uses  a  Gaussian  filter  with  the  specified
     half-frequency  in all 3 dimensions.  For the filtered image
     to be interpretable, the input image should have been recon-
     structed  with a ramp filter with cutoff at the Nyquist fre-
     quency.

     The output filename is optional; if not specified, a  common
     default name is created.

     The output file will be in Interfile format,  which  can  be
     converted  to most of the other formats. Currently, the out-
     put file is stored as short integers, which means fractional
     pixels are rounded and values exceeding 32767 are truncated.

     gauss3d is functionally similar to gauss except that gauss3d
     handles  more  image  formats while gauss writes a CTI ver 7
     file (which also uses short integers but contains a  scaling
     factor to handle larger values and preserve dynamic range).


PARAMETERS
     infile    - input image filename
     outfile   - output filename (optional)
     half_freq - half frequency (cycles/cm)

RESOLUTION OF MR IMAGES
     For images where the resolution is assumed to be  equivalent
     to 1 pixel.  The resolutions were measured on simulated data
     (a delta function of a single pixel).

RESOLUTION OF FILTERED 953B IMAGES
     For images reconstructed with ramp filter and then processed
     by  gauss3d.  The resolutions were measured on a line source
     in air and represent the central 11  slices  of  a  31-slice
     image.   Resolution  for  3-D  images  is greater in the end
     slices.  [Round all of these to the nearest 1/2 cm for cita-
     tions.]

RESOLUTION OF FILTERED 961 IMAGES
     For images  reconstructed  with  ramp  filter  and  scatter-
     correction  and  then processed by gauss3d.  The resolutions
     were measured on a  line  source  in  water  and  positioned
     approximately  1  cm  from  the center of the aperture. FWHM
     represents the central 25 slices of a 47-slice image.  While
     resolution for 2-D images is constant through all 47 slices,
     Resolution for 3-D images is significantly  greater  in  the
     end  slices (less than slice 12 or greater than slice 37 for
     images with no axial smoothing).
