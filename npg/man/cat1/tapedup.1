TAPEDUP(1)                User Commands                TAPEDUP(1)



NAME
     tapedup - Copy a complete exatape from a local  drive  to  a
     remote drive.


SYNOPSIS
     tapedup <remote_host>


DESCRIPTION
     This  program  copies  a  tape  from  a  local  tape   drive
     (/dev/rst1)  to  one  on  another  Sun  (/dev/rst1  on  that
     machine).  Write-protect the tape in the local drive  before
     inserting the tape to be copied, and be sure the the tape in
     the remote drive is not write-protected.  Also, be sure that
     you have the correct id of the remote host so that you don't
     write over someone else's tape.

     Both tapes are rewound before initiating the copy, and  both
     tapes are rewound and ejected upon completion of the copy.

     Normal output is (assuming petsun3 is the remote):
          petsun3 is alive
          rewinding local tape
          rewinding tape in petsun3
          copying local tape to petsun3 tape at
               Fri Jun 26 08:00:00 CDT 1992
          [copytape: can't read input: I/O error]
          rewinding local tape
          rewinding tape in petsun3
          tapedup complete at Fri Jun 26 08:30:10 CDT 1992

     A tone is sounded locally upon completion.

     Note that tapedup may end with the error message: "copytape:
     can't  read input: I/O error".  This is not unusual and does
     not mean the copy did not run successfully.  To  verify  the
     copy you should always use tapedir (see manual page).
