NAME
     plotcrv - plot a blood curve file


SYNOPSIS
     plotcrv filename


DESCRIPTION
     This is a script which calls gnuplot to plot the points in a
     blood  curve  file  (.crv).  The axes of the plot are autos-
     caled to the data set.

     The plot may either be displayed on your terminal or sent to
     a  printer,  an  option which you are prompted for after the
     script has read the file.


EXAMPLE
     plotcrv p2000ho1.crv

     Do you wish to: (1)  Plot curves on screen or
                     (2)  Print them on your default printer?

     hit return to continue

     Note that while plotcrv will take a wild card in for input, i.e.,
     "plotcrv p5000*crt", be sure to include the extension! If you simply
     enter "plotcrv p5000*" it will attempt use all files (including image
     files).
