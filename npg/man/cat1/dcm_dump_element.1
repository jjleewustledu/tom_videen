NAME
     dcm_dump_element - dump one element from a DICOM file header


SYNOPSIS
     dcm_dump_element [-b] [-t] [-v] group element filein fileout

     -b   read input in big-endian format
     -t   read in DICOM Part 10 format
     -v   verbose mode


DESCRIPTION
     dcm_dump_element reads one element from  a  DICOM  file  and
     writes the date to a file.

     Some files require the "-t"  flag  and  others  require  its
     absence. If you get lots of errors, try the opposite.
