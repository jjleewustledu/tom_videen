NAME
     setpixval - set to value pixels >= min AND <= max in mask


SYNOPSIS
     setpixval input mask output min max setval


PARAMETERS
     input  - filename of input image
     mask   - filename of masking image
     output - filename of masked image
     min    - mask if >= this intensity in mask
     max    - mask if <= this intensity in mask
     setval - value to assign to masked pixels


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads 2 Analyze images and sets all  pixels  in
     the  first  which  have values both >= min AND <= max in the
     mask to specified value.

     This masked image is written to the output file  in  ANALYZE
     format.

     setpixval differs from maskand which  masks  itself  leaving
     only pixels fitting the criterion. In setpixval, the mask is
     a second image and pixels which do  not  fit  the  criterion
     have their original, unchanged values in the final image.


EXAMPLE
     setpixval p5000brain p5000vent p5000tis 1 100 1
