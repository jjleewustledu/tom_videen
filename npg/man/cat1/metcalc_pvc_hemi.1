NAME
     metcalc_pvc_hemi - compute CBF, CBV, OEF, CMRO2 from  counts
     and hdrs


SYNOPSIS
     metcalc_pvc_hemi datafile


DESCRIPTION
     metcalc_pvc_hemi computes global, left and right hemispheric
     CBF,  CBV,  OEF,  and  CMRO2 from regional PET counts from a
     spideram output file.

     The spideram file is the output from Global Averaging run as
     "Whole  Slice  plus Right/Left Hemispheres" on 4 images (all
     masked to tissue and all with  the  same  high  resolution).
     These are run twice (processing as PET counts) first using a
     large whole-brain mask generated by spideram (templating  in
     Display  section) and then using a smaller mask (creating by
     stripping additional pixels from the first mask.

     The order of processing is fixed and assumed to be:
          A) Larger masked volume
               1) ho
               2) oc
               3) oo
               4) tis
          B) Smaller masked volume
               5) ho
               6) oc
               7) oo
               8) tis

     metcalc_pvc_hemi first creates a .sum  file  which  contains
     only  the global summary values from the input file. It then
     reads the hdr file names, mean counts (global, left,  right)
     and pixels for each processed image and computes the partial
     volume corrected mean cbf, cbv, oef and  cmro2  for  global,
     left and right hemispheres.
