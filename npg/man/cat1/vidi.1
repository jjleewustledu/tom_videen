NAME
     vidi - image visualization


DESCRIPTION
     Vidi reads and displays images in PETT VI, CTI/ECAT versions
     6  and 7, Analyze, and Interfile formats.  Programs exist to
     convert Siemens MR and CT images to Analyze/Interfile format
     (see  related programs below).  Image filenames may be typed
     or selected  from  a  scrollable  list  by  selecting  File.
     Images  may  be displayed in transverse, coronal or sagittal
     sections.  Color scales are selectable for each  image.  The
     default colors for both images is the 20-color PET rainbow.

     If the third window used to display a composite  image,  the
     larger  peaks  of image 2 will be painted over image 1.  The
     cutoff for image 2 during the paint over  is  selected  from
     the  Scale  menu.   This  may  be useful for visualizing the
     accuracy of intermodality alignment or for visualizing func-
     tional  activations  on an anatomical image.  When using the
     feature, select the linear grayscale for image 1  color  and
     load the CT or MR image as image 1.

     Moving the cursor in any of the 3 display windows will print
     the  image  coordinates  of  the cursor position in the main
     menu box. This may be useful  to  select  the  plane  of  an
     orthogonal section for viewing.

     One entire frame of each image is  read  into  memory  at  a
     time,  which  permits  rapid  switch  to different planes or
     orientations but does grab  lots  of  system  resources  for
     large data sets. If it takes more than a few seconds to read
     an image, try running vidi from a host with more RAM  (using
     the  usual  xhost/setenv  DISPLAY  stuff  for remote display
     applications).  You can check the memory installed on a  Sun
     with "dmesg | grep mem".  Also, perfmeter will reveal exces-
     sive page activity.  (If  in  doubt,  petsun23  and  24  are
     currently tops in RAM.)

     All fields in which you can type an entry  (e.g.,  Filename,
     Frm, Max, Min, %Cutoff) require entering Return or the entry
     will not be read!


LOGFILE
     A logfile is created whenever vidi is called with  the  name
     vidi_stats_$$.log  where  the  last  part  of  the name is a
     unique number (Unix process id).  The file will  have  a  1-
     line entry every time you get statistics on a VOI (using the
     Statistic button in the VOI menu). This line will contain:
        1) image filename
        2) VOI name

        3) either the plane number on which the VOI  values  were
        extracted  OR  "---"  if  values  were extracted from all
        planes on which the VOI  is  defined  (the  first  option
        under the pulldown selection for Statistics).
        4) processing type (i.e., cnts, cbf, cbv, oef, etc.)
        5) mean
        6) number of pixels
        7) SD (only for processing as counts)

     If the log file is empty (no statistics were computed),  the
     file  will  automatically be deleted when vidi exits. If you
     do not have write permission in the directory where you call
     vidi, no log will be created.
