NAME
     imgrotate - rotates and reslices an ECAT image


SYNOPSIS
     imgrotate infile airfile [Xdeg Ydeg Zdeg]


DESCRIPTION
     Reads an ECAT image, rotates it, and saves it to a new  ECAT
     file  which will have the same name with the additional pre-
     fix "r".

     If no values are entered for degrees, an existing  air  file
     is used to reslice the input file. If the pixel sizes differ
     between the current input file and the original file used to
     create  the  air  file,  then the pixel sizes should be made
     uniform (if appropriate) in all files  before  creating  the
     air file and reslicing. This may be done with setpixsize and
     may be checked with imghdr.

     Otherwise, all angles are in degrees. Positive angles rotate
     the image clockwise as viewed in vidi. Hence, +Xdeg tips the
     nose up (backwards), +Ydeg tilts the top of head  to  right,
     and  +Zdeg  rotates  the  nose to right.  When more than one
     angle is non-zero, the combined rotation may differ slightly
     from that specified for some of the angles.

     This script uses manualreslice (AIR) and converts  the  ECAT
     file to an intermediate file in Analyze format (img2analyze)
     and  then  back  to  ECAT  format  (analyze2img)  after  the
     reslice.
