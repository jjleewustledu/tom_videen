NAME
     betadcv - creates a deconvolved blood curve (dcv)


SYNOPSIS
     betadcv crtfile (with no extension)


DESCRIPTION
     Betadcv runs interactively,  creating  a  blood  curve  file
     which  needs  to  be  time shifted before used for metabolic
     processing  with  metproc.   It  deconvolves   the   sampled
     arterial  blood  curve to create a blood curve for the head.
     Three deconvolution parameters are  computed  based  on  the
     catheter  tubing,  the flow rate (constant at 5 cc/min), and
     the hematocrit.  The deconvolution algorithm is identical to
     that developed by Avi Snyder in betadta.

     Decay-correction uses  the  decay  constants  originally  in
     meteval.  Where  a different value is now thought more accu-
     rate, metproc  will  restore  decay  using  these  constants
     before  applying  corrections using the current values.  The
     halflives (sec) applied in betadcv are:

         O-15  122.1     (metproc changes to 122.3)
         N-13  597.8
         C-11  1223.
         Ga-68 4100.
         F-18  6583.2
         NONE  1.0E+9


     Oxygen processing requires the addition of 2 points  at  the
     end  of  the  curve  from a hand-drawn sample.  The first of
     these is whole blood counts and the second is plasma counts.
     These  points  will  be  shifted  along with the rest of the
     blood curve in makedta (differs from betadta).

     The output dcv file  created  will  have  2  columns,  which
     represent:
          1) Time (secs)
          2) Decay-corrected, deconvolved blood curve (unshifted)

     Input files have the extension .crt or  .crv  (new  sampler;
     see below).


NOTES
     To run betadcv you will need a calibration factor.  This  is
     usually  done by Lennis using betacal and should be found on
     a sheet in the patient file. You can also compute one  if  a
     .wel  file  exists  and  you know the sampling period of the

     well counter (usually either 10 or 12 sec).

     Crt files created by the new PC (in NNICU Feb 25, 2002) have
     the  extension  .crv.   Also, these new files have erroneous
     values in the first 2 time bins.  The counts in these 2 bins
     should be set equal to that of the third bin to get an accu-
     rate  blood  curve  (a  prompt  will  appear  when   running
     betadcv).
