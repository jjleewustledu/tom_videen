NAME
     plothcrv - plot ECAT (ver 7) headcurve files (.r)


SYNOPSIS
     plothcrv PID


DESCRIPTION
     This is an IDL program which plots  headcurves  for  dynamic
     scans  (2  or more frames).  It plots trues/sec vs. time and
     shows the start of frame 2  and the total number of frames.

     It will pause after plotting each headcurve found  with  the
     specified PID and continue when you enter Return.

     Sometimes there are spikes (either high or low) in the head-
     curves  at  the  time  of a frame change. These may be elim-
     inated manually by editing the file and deleting the line on
     which these appear.


EXAMPLE
     plothcrv p6000
