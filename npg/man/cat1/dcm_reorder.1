NAME
     dcm_reorder - renumbers DICOM filenames to eliminate gaps


SYNOPSIS
     dcm_reorder first last


DESCRIPTION
     dcm_reorder renumbers the scans between first  and  last  so
     that  the sequence is continuous. I.e., if a slice number is
     missing, all files following it are moved up a number. It is
     useful  when  there  is a duplicate slice in a series (which
     often happens with CT) or when combining two TSE sequences.

     The filenames must be a  5  digit  number  followed  by  the
     extension .dcm; i.e., "00132.dcm".

     This perl script calls the program dcm_dump_element from the
     ERL DICOM package.


EXAMPLES
     dcm_reorder 4 131
