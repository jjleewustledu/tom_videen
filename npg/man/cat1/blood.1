NAME
     Blood is used for manually entering blood  curves  from  PET
     scans.   The  entered  data  is usually stored in a dta file
     (used by metproc) but it can used to compute decay-corrected
     counts  without saving values.  Metproc uses the blood curve
     data to compute parameters (saved in hdr  files)  which  are
     used  by  spideram,  vidi  and  voistat to display metabolic
     images or to process VOIs which metabolic values.


SYNOPSIS
     blood filename


DESCRIPTION
     The filename will have the extension dta  and  normally  has
     the same root as the subject ID.

     Blood computes the decay-corrected counts/(ml*sec) for  each
     blood sample.

     The user enters the dry and wet syringe weights (grams), the
     times at which the blood was drawn and counted, and the well
     counts per n seconds (usually n =  10,  but  variable  count
     periods can be specified).  For all types of scans the start
     time, length of the scan, and peak bank  pairs  are  entered
     (bank  pairs  were  relevant  only for PETT VI).  For oxygen
     scans the blood oxygen content (ml/ml)  and  hematocrit  are
     entered, and the last point in the blood curve should be the
     well counts for plasma.

     Conversion factors for g/ml  of  whole  blood  and  g/ml  of
     plasma  are  contained in the program.  There are correction
     factors for the position and  volume  of  the  blood  sample
     placed in the well counter. Blood counts are decay-corrected
     from the time they were counted to  the  time  of  injection
     using the first-listed halflives in Lederer & Shirley, Table
     of Isotopes, 1978 (7th edition), John Wiley.

     Note that blood currently uses the 'old'  halflife  for  O15
     (122.1  sec)  rather  than  the  current and presumably most
     accurate one (122.3 sec). This is done to maintain  compati-
     bility  with  meteval  and  all old image files processed by
     meteval.  Petproc and metproc  remove  the  decay-correction
     using  this old halflife and then use the 122.3 halflife for
     processing.

     Note that blood always includes either a  blood  density  or
     plasma  density factor in its calculations.  Therefore, this
     program will NOT yield correct values if it is used on  sam-
     ples  of  water or any solutions other than blood or plasma.
     Blood also applies a correction factor based on  the  amount

     and  position  of  the sample in the well counter.  If a new
     syringe is used for samples, this correction factor must  be
     checked.

     The decay correction first computes the corrected counts  at
     the start time of the well counter period using the halflife
     and measured well counts (which is the integral of the  ini-
     tial counts plus decay during the well counter period). Then
     this value is decay corrected  to  the  time  of  injection.
     (This correction is more accurate than using the midpoint of
     the well counter period.)

     Blood stores all values entered by the user.  Thus, in addi-
     tion  to  2  columns  for  the  corrected time of the sample
     shifted for the  arterial  delay)  and  the  decay-corrected
     counts,  there  are  6  columns  for the syringe dry and wet
     weights, the actual sample time, the  time  the  sample  was
     counted,  the  measured counts, and the duration of the well
     count.

     Blood curve points may be added, deleted, or altered  within
     blood.  The sample time should be shifted to correct for the
     arterial delay to the brain within blood.   Note  that  this
     shift  alters  the time of the first column of the dta file,
     but does not alter the time in the fifth column (the  actual
     sample  time).  Thus, the shift that is currently is readily
     apparent in the dta file (and  is  displayed  while  running
     blood).   Points  which  have  negative  times  after  being
     shifted remain in the dta file, but will be ignored by  met-
     proc.

     Dta files created by blood may be reprocessed  by  rerunning
     blood  to  add,  delete  or  alter  points, or to change the
     amount of shift. Blood curves (dta files) can  be  displayed
     or printed using plotdta.

     Every time a dta file is viewed with blood, its  values  are
     reprocessed.   Since  the dta file does not contain informa-
     tion about the type of syringe used, it is therefore impera-
     tive  that  the user respond properly to the first 3 prompts
     of the program as the default responses are _n_o_t  necessarily
     the responses appropriate to the file.


DTA FILE STRUCTURE
     First line is a 4-character code string  followed  by  text.
     The  second and third lines are column headers for the blood
     points.  The fourth line has the number of  curves  in  this
     file.

     _________________________________________________________________
     Notes:

     1) Corrected Time = sample time (seconds after injection;
        shifted);

     2) Corrected Counts = decay-corrected wellcounts/(ml*sec);
        Decay correction is to the time of injection;
        Conversion is from counts/(g*time) to counts/(ml*sec);
        (using density of whole blood or plasma, as appropriate)
        (time is the period given in the last column)

     3) For scantype=1, if the hematocrit is not 0, then the
        last point in the blood curve is the well counts for
        plasma taken from the same sample as the whole blood in
        the next to last point;

     4) Scan ID is the last 3-4 characters of the scan file name;
        e.g., for p1000ho1.img, the scan ID would be ho1;

     5) Scan Types: (aka ntype)
        1 = O-15 Oxygen Metabolism Study  (oo)
        2 = O-15 Water Blood Flow Study   (ho)
        3 = O-15 Blood Volume Study       (co)
        4 = C-11 Butanol Blood Flow Study (bu)
        5 = F-18 Study
        6 = Misc. Study
        7 = O-15 Oxygen Steady-State Study (oo)
        8 = O-15 Oxygen Steady-Inhalation plasma curve (oo)
        9 = O-15 Oxygen Steady-Inhalation whole-blood  (oo)

     6) Peak Bank Pairs was read off the scanner by the operator during
        the scan, and was a measure of the counting rate of for PETT VI
        (and was used to estimate the deadtime correction). Its value is
        irrelevant for processing ECAT scanner data.
