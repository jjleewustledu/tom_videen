NAME
     fid_dif - reads 2  files  which  contain  coordinates  of  6
     points (3D) and returns the vector difference between them


SYNOPSIS
     fid_dif


DESCRIPTION
     This program requests the names of  2  files  which  contain
     coordinates  of  6 points created by fit_fiducials.  It com-
     putes the vector distance between all  of  the  points,  the
     mean  difference,  as  well  as  the mean difference in each
     axis.  These values are written to the screen (standard out)
     as  well  as  to a file created from the difference of the 2
     input names (i.e., mr16.fid and n16.fid  will  create  mr16-
     n16.fid).


INPUT FILE FORMAT
     Input files may have any name but must contain 6 rows and  3
     columns of real numbers:

           68.3834      169.627      82.6594
