TARCHIVE(1)               User Commands               TARCHIVE(1)



NAME
     tarchive - perform ACS tape archive of all scans on a disk


SYNOPSIS
     tarchive sd0 -prefix p -suffix b -blank 941231  -nrm  941227
     -wait hours -mail tom@npg -no3d -debug


PARAMETERS
     disk    - ACS disk to archive (the only required parameter)
     -prefix - prefix for study files (default is both "p" and "m")
     -suffix - suffix for studyname (default none)
     -blank  - date of blank scans (default is today)
     -nrm    - date of normalization files (default is most recent)
     -wait   - delay 'nhour' hours before executing (default is 0)
     -mail   - mail the report to this person (don't forget @npg)
     -no3d   - do not archive plane_eff_3d.scn or strblnk.scn
               (default is archive them)
     -debug  - will skip archiving (use it to test your parameter
               selection; nothing will write to the tape)


DESCRIPTION
     Archives ACS files associated with all specified  study  IDs
     to  8mm  tape  using  the arccreate/arcverify commands.  The
     only required parameter is the first one:  disk  name  (sd0,
     sd1,  sd2).  All other parameters are optional and may be in
     any order.

     All blank scans for the specified (or current) day  will  be
     archived.  The current day is the date when the tape archive
     of a particular study BEGINS.   If  you  start  the  command
     "tarchive"  and  you  think  that  any  study  may not begin
     transfer to tape before midnight, use the  "-blank"  parame-
     ter!

     All normalization files for the specified (or  most  recent)
     date  will  be archived.  Blank and normalization files MUST
     be on sd0.  Study files (beginning with the prefix) must  be
     on the disk specified on the command line.

     If "-wait" is specified, the tape transfer will  be  delayed
     for  the  specified  number  of hours.  Two or more separate
     tarchive commands may be  started  for  the  same  night  by
     delaying the second to begin after the first is complete (or
     by issuing both commands from within a shell  script  file).
     This  allows  studies from more than one disk to be saved in
     one night.  The script will execute in background by  either
     appending  "&"  to  the command line or by entering "Ctrl-Z"
     followed by "bg" after it has started.

     The studies  to  archive  should  begin  with  the  "prefix"
     entered.   This may be either a single character (p, m) or a
     string (p25, p2123, phan1).  If no prefix is specified,  all
     files  beginning with either m or p (excepting "plane") will
     be considered separate studies for archiving.

     Study names created on the tape will consist of the  subject
     ID,  an  underscore, today's date, and the suffix entered on
     the command line.  I.e., p2000_950116  or  p2000_950116b  if
     "-suffix  b"  was  entered.   The suffix should be used when
     part of a data set is archived twice to the same  tape.   If
     you attempt to archive the same data twice (without removing
     the first set  with  arceom),  arcverify  will  (presumably)
     check  the  first  copy on the tape.  Both prefixes and suf-
     fixes may be 1 or more characters.

     A report is produced which summarizes the success or failure
     of  each transfer.  This report is both printed on the laser
     printer and mailed to a designated  person.   The  arcverify
     report  is  appended  to a file in /ecat_data/tapes with the
     same name as the tape label.

     All verify errors  should  be  treated  seriously  with  the
     exception of:
        "arcVerifyOkProc:Archive error... unexpected end of file"
     when this  error  comes  after  ALL  individual  files  have
     reported  "File  Archived  OK".  It is not clear what causes
     this, but it does not appear to have any effect on the data.

     The message:
        "There is nnnn bytes of space remaining"
     is irrelevant.  The estimate of space was designed  for  the
     original tape drive and does not reflect the free space with
     the new 8505 tape drive.

     NOTE: This command only works  on  the  ECAT  console  (pet-
     sun11).


STUDY NAMES
     Study names will be created using the entered prefix.  Study
     names  will  always  have  2-5 characters beginning with 1-5
     letters [a-z] and ending with 0-4 numbers [0-9].


EXAMPLES
     tarchive sd0

          Archives all studies /sd0/p* and /sd0/m* with all nrm files.

     tarchive sd0 -debug

          Check which studies and nrm files will be archived.

     tarchive sd1 -prefix p25 -no3d

          Archive studies /sd1/p25* with 2d normalization files.

     tarchive sd2 -prefix p2

          Archive studies /sd2/p* with both 2d and 3d nrm files.

     tarchive sd0 -prefix p2500 -blank 950110 -nrm 950106 -wait 8 -mail jth@npg

          Archive study p2500 with the blanks from 950110, the nrms from 950106,
          wait 8 hours before beginning the tape, and mail a report to jth.
