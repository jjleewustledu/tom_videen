T88SING(1)                User Commands                T88SING(1)



NAME
     t88sing - transform single  PETT  VI  or  ECAT  images  into
     Talairach 1988 atlas space.

SYNOPSIS
     t88sing prm imagelist


DESCRIPTION
     This script converts single PET  images  into  single  atlas
     images based on:

     Talairach, J. & Tournoux, P.  (1988)  Co-planar  stereotaxic
     atlas of the human brain. New York: Thieme.

     T88sing separates an  imagelist  into  single  lists  (using
     /tmp) and then processes these lists to create a set of sin-
     gle images.  Processes either filtered or unfiltered images.
     Deletes all temporary files on /tmp.

     Imagelists and parameter lists are the same as those used by
     t88mean.  However, imagelists MUST have each field separated
     by a SINGLE TAB and should not have any comment lines

     Output filenames are created using the parameter and imagel-
     ist files and are always given the extension .t88.


BUGS
     Whereas nearly all other programs do not care what  kind  of
     "white  space"  you  use  in the imagelist (spaces or tabs),
     t88sing requires a single tab separating each  field.  Also,
     t88sing  does  not  like comment lines (lines beginning with
     #).  If you do not have this, you will see the  error  "set:
     Syntax error." with no other explanation.

     Also, do not have any blank lines in your file (such  as  at
     the end of the list).
