Name
     pvc_tsc - create partial-volume-corrected tissue-activity file


SYNOPSIS
     pvc_tsc datafile tissue_volume


DESCRIPTION
     This perl script applies a partial-volume-correction  factor
     to a tissue-activity data file.

     The input datafile is a  sped-file  with  3  columns  (frame
     start   time,  frame  duration,  and  total  decay-corrected
     counts) typically created by make_tsc.

     The tissue_volume factor represents the proportion of  brain
     tissue comprising the VOI used to derive the tissue-activity
     curve.  It is the fractional tissue contribution times  1000
     (i.e., 100% tissue = 1000).

     Tissue volume is typically computed by running  vstat  on  a
     convolved  tissue  image  using  the same VOI from which the
     time-activity curve was derived.


EXAMPLE
