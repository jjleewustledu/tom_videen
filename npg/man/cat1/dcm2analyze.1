NAME
     dcm2analyze - Converts MR images from DICOM to  Analyze  and
     Interfile format (img, hdr, and ifh files).


SYNOPSIS
     dcm2analyze first last output_root [flag]

     Setting flag to 'm' identifies a prone monkey whose head  is
     facing forward rather than down. Without passing a flag, the
     head orientation is assumed to be  correctly  identified  by
     the DICOM header.


DESCRIPTION
     dcm2analyze reads multiple, sequential  MR  image  files  in
     DICOM  format, reorients them to the 3D ordering expected by
     Analyze and writes a single image file comprising all slices
     plus  an  Analyze header file (.hdr) and an Interfile Format
     header file (.ifh).  It  does  not  change  the  input  data
     except for reorientation; specifically, it does not generate
     voxels with uniform, cubic dimensions.

     Input DICOM files must be named with a 5 digit  number  fol-
     lowed  by the extension .dcm; i.e., "00001.dcm". The program
     "dcm_rename" converts Siemens DICOM filenames to names  with
     this format.

     The Analyze orientation will match  labels  within  Analyze.
     Note  that  Analyze  thinks  in radiological orientation and
     displays right-on-left (viewing the body from the feet).

     Monkeys scanned "prone" but with head facing forward may  be
     reoriented by passing an "m" as the third parameter.

     Use dcmscans to determine the file numbers corresponding  to
     the MR sequence.

     dcm2analyze calls dcm_slice_reorder  before  converting  the
     files to set all the slice positions in increasing numerical
     order.


NOTE
     Use dcm_ct2analyze for CT DICOM files!


EXAMPLES
     dcm2analyze 4 131 p5000_mprage
     dcm2analyze 4 72 stretch_mprage m
