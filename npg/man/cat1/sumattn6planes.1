NAME
     sumattn6planes - computes mean attenuation across all planes


SYNOPSIS
     sumattn6planes atn_file


DESCRIPTION
     This program computes the mean of all  31  planes  of  ECAT6
     attenuation  files.   The  input file has the extension .atn
     and the output file will be given the suffix _sum.atn.

     The program was  developed  for  tests  of  fpattn6  and  is
     undoubtedly useful only with uniform phantoms.
