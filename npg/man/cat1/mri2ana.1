NAME
     mri2ana - Converts any set of  Siemens  MR  image  files  to
     ANALYZE  files  (img  & hdr) an Interfile Format header file
     (ifh)


SYNOPSIS
     mri2ana <mri root> <sequence num> <Analyze root>


DESCRIPTION
     mri2anal  reads  multiple,  sequential   MR   image   files,
     reorients  them  to the 3-D ordering expected by Analyze and
     writes a single image file comprising  all  slices  plus  an
     Analyze  hdr  file  and an Interfile Format header file.  It
     does not change the input  data  except  for  reorientation;
     specifically,  it  does  not  generate  voxels with uniform,
     cubic dimensions.

     The extension "ima" is assumed for all MR image files.

     The extensions "img", "hdr", and "ifh" are used  for  output
     files.

     The Analyze orientation will match  labels  within  Analyze.
     Note  that  Analyze  thinks  in radiological orientation and
     displays right-on-left (viewing the body from the feet).

     This program should work with all Siemens MR  images.   How-
     ever,  with  older images from the VAX-based scanners, it is
     possible that the bytes in your data set were swapped  some-
     where  along the line.  Should you get an error message that
     you image is "not a valid image file" and you are  convinced
     otherwise,  try  swapping bytes with a script something like
     the following:

     set files = `ls *.ima`
     foreach i ($files)
     ? dd if=$i of=x$i bs=256 conv="swab"
     ? end

     The new files (beginning with x) may work fine.


NOTES ON ORIENTATION
     While this program should produce  output  in  a  consistent
     orientation  (with  transverse  sections),  it has only been
     validated with MR images in View_LtoR (sagittal).   While  I
     believe  there  is  reasonable  checking,  any definition of
     orientation which has View_Head starting with the  slice  at
     top of the head and View_LtoR starting with the slice on the
     right might be expected to have other surprises.
