NAME
     dupifh - duplicate an Interfile header for a new image


SYNOPSIS
     dupifh reference_header new_image


DESCRIPTION
     Duplicates an Interfile header for a new image file  (floats
     or  short  integers) by copying parameters from the existing
     Interfile header while changing the image file name.

     This was designed specifically to create an Interfile header
     for  perfusion  images generated by local software using the
     Interfile header created by mri2analyze using  the  last  8-
     slice  acquisition of an ep_fid series. The perfusion images
     must be created  using  the  same  voxel  ordering  as  that
     created  by  mri2analyze  (which  uses the Analyze standard:
     right->left; posterior->anterior; inferior->superior).


EXAMPLE
     dupifh vc4103_ep_fid80.ifh vc4103_cbf.dat
