SCALEIMAGE(1)             User Commands             SCALEIMAGE(1)



NAME
     scaleimage - scales pixel values in an ECAT image file


SYNOPSIS
     scaleimage filename factor


DESCRIPTION
     scaleimage applies the specified factor to all planes of  an
     ECAT image file.  This adjust the pixel magnitude to produce
     values more suitable for  programs  which  work  with  short
     integers  (i.e.,  values  from  -32768  to 32767).  This can
     either eliminate annoying black holes (from  values  outside
     this  range)  or increase the dynamic range (for images with
     small integer values).  The scaling factor applied is  writ-
     ten to the study_description field of the main header in the
     output file, where it may be checked with imghdr.

     The scaled image can be restored to the  original  image  by
     scaling  a  second  time with the reciprocal of the original
     factor.

     A recfile is created.


PARAMETERS
     filename - input image filename
     factor   - real scaler applied to the image


EXAMPLE
     scaleimage p3000ho1.v. 0.1
