NAME
     maskpct - create a mask image (with pixels = 0 or 1)


SYNOPSIS
     maskpct input output threshold [planes]


PARAMETERS
     input     - filename of image to be masked
     output    - filename of output image
     threshold - percent of maximum pixel count
     planes    - range of slices to search for maximum


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads any PET image, searches for  the  maximum
     pixel  value  (using  the  range  of slices specified or all
     slices if not), and then creates a  template  of  the  input
     image  including all pixels within the boundary of pixels >=
     the percent threshold times  the  maximum.   This  templated
     image  is  written to the output file with all pixels having
     values of 0 or 1.

     The output image file will have the same format as the input
     file (e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).


NOTES
     Based on a comparison of the brain widths in MR images  with
     the  edges  of thresholded 953B PET images (Haller, MacLeod,
     et al) the following percent threshold of whole  brain  max-
     imum  PET  counts  should approximate the brain width at the
     level of the ACPC plane.  Note that whole brain maximum does
     NOT include larger peaks which commonly occur in the nose or
     carotids in some subjects.
