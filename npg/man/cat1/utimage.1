NAME
     utimage - create an unpaired-t image from 6 input images


SYNOPSIS
     utimage test_mean control_mean


DESCRIPTION
     utimage reads 6 files created by t88mean and  combines  them
     to create an image of pixel t-values.  A rec file is created
     with the output file.

     The 6 input files are:
          test.t88     - mean of group 1 (mean1)
          test.sd      - pixel standard deviation for group 1 (sd1)
          test.n       - number of subjects contributing to each pixel for group 1 (n1)
          control.t88  - mean of group 2 (mean2)
          control.sd   - pixel standard deviation for group 2 (sd2)
          control.n    - number of subjects contributing to each pixel for group 2 (n2)

     The output files are:
          test-control.t      - unpaired t image (t)
          test-control.t.rec  - rec file summarizing processing

     The complete input filenames should be  specified  for  test
     and control mean images.  All other filenames are created by
     stripping of any extension  (all  characters  following  the
     first ".") and appending the extensions indicated (either sd
     or n).


ALGORITHM
     t = 1000 * (mean1-mean2) / sqrt[(sd1*sd1/n1) + (sd2*sd2/n2)]

     where the files are defined as above.  Computations are done
     pixel-by-pixel.   If n1 <= 0, n2 <= 0, sd1 <= 0 or sd2 <= 0,
     then t is set to 0.

     Note:  The pixel t-values are all multipled by 1000 to avoid
     truncation   by  software  which  handles  image  arrays  as
     integers for display (e.g., spideram).
