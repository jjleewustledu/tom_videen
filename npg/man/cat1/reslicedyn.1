NAME
     reslicedyn - reslice frames from a dynamic image


SYNOPSIS
     reslicedyn root ext frms reference_frame original_image

     where:
       root            = root for input image filenames
       ext             = extension for input image files
       frms            = frames to align
       reference_frame = frame used as reference for aligndyn
       original_image  = original, unaligned dynamic image


DESCRIPTION
     This script reslices all specified frames of a dynamic image
     using AIR files created by aligndyn.

     Before running reslicedyn, you  must  have  created  single-
     frame   images   from   the   dynamic   image  using  either
     singlefrm_gauss or separate_dynframes. If these are  not  in
     Analyze format, they will be converted by reslicedyn.

     You must also have created combined air  files  by  aligning
     each image to the first (reference_frame) using aligndyn.

     The program creates:
          1) resliced images in ECAT format (which always begin with 'r')
          2) corresponding hdr files if they exist for the original images

     The program  creates  (as  an  intermediate  step)  resliced
     images  in  Analyze format, but these will be removed during
     the processing.

     The program uses img2analyze,  analyze2img,  and  imgreslice
     (which  in  turn uses setanamin and mv_air, and reslice from
     the UCLA AIR package).


NOTE
     The reslice images should be in the same format (ECAT  6  or
     7) as the original image specified on the command line.


EXAMPLES
     reslicedyn m500mb .i 1to44 3 m500mb1.img
     reslicedyn p5000fd _g3.v 2to55 3 p5000fdg1.v
