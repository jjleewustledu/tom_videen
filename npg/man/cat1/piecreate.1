NAME
     piecreate -- creates a PET-to-well counts  conversion  file,
     referred  to  as  a  'pie' file using information from a pie
     data file (PDF), a regional values file (RGT) and  an  image
     file.


SYNOPSIS
     piecreate PDF_file RGT_file PIE_file

     All 3 file names are entered with NO extensions.   The  pro-
     gram  will look for files with either lowercase or uppercase
     extensions (in that order).  The PIE file created will  have
     lowercase extension (.pie)


DESCRIPTION
     This program uses the information in an  'RGT'  file  and  a
     'PDF' file to create a 'PIE' file.  RGT files are created by
     spideram.  PDF files are created by piedata.

     The program prompts for the name of a single image file used
     to  generate the RGT file.  This should be an emission image
     of the phantom.  The program will read the  header  of  this
     file  and use its file type to assign a file type to the pie
     file.

     Image File          Type      PIE File Type
     Old PETT VI         1000           3
     New PETT VI         1020           5
     ECAT 953B           3000           7

     Pie files with type 5 (new  reconstruction)  will  have  the
     scan  date  and  mean  NORM counts/bin/minute written as the
     last line of the pie file.  Hence, the NORM  time  and  NORM
     average  are read from the image file when its type is 1020.
     Image files reconstructed with the new stream  prior  to  8-
     Mar-89 only have these values in the attenuation image file;
     after this data, any of the image files may  be  read.   The
     program will indicate if the NORM time and average cannot be
     read from the header and ask for an attenuation image.  ECAT
     pie  files  will  show the scan date, but the mean NORM will
     always be 1.0.

ALGORITHMS
     The program computes a weighted-average of bank pairs during
     the  scan  given the starting bank pairs using the following
     formula:

     average bank pair = 0.5*bankpair*(1-exp(-2*alpha*time)
                         ----------------------------------
                                (1-exp(-alpha*time))

          bankpair = starting bank pair
          alpha = decay constant (1/sec)
          time  = length of scan (sec)

     The program computes mean PET  counts/pixel  by  taking  the
     mean  of  the  regional  values  for all 7 slices (i.e., the
     values in  the  RGT  file).   The  mean  counts  are  decay-
     corrected  to  the reference time using the following formu-
     lae:

     a) decay correct mean PET counts/pixe/sec in  each  scan  to
     the scan start:

          PET1 =    meancnts*alpha
                 --------------------
                 (1-exp(-alpha*time))

          meancnts = mean PET counts/pixel/scan from RGT file
          alpha = decay constant (1/sec)
          time  = length of scan (sec)

     b) convert to mean PET counts/pixel/minute:

          PET2 = 60*PET1

     c) decay correct PET counts in each scan to reference time:

          PET3 = PET2*exp(alpha*time))

          time  = reference time - count time (sec)

     The conversion factor,  or 'pieslope', written  to  the  PIE
     file is computed by first computing the mean decay-corrected
     well counts by taking the mean of  the  values  in  the  PDF
     file.  This value is then divided by the decay-corrected PET
     counts.

          PETTCONV = wellcnts/PET3

          wellcnts = mean well counts/sec/ml  decay-corrected  to
               reference time

          PET3 = mean  PET  counts/min/pixel  decay-corrected  to
