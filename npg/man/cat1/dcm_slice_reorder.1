NAME
     dcm_slice_reorder - reorders DICOM scans by slice position


SYNOPSIS
     dcm_slice_reorder first last


DESCRIPTION
     dcm_slice_reorder renumbers the scans between first and last
     so  slice positions run from low to high continuously. It is
     useful when combining two TSE sequences.

     The filenames must be a  5  digit  number  followed  by  the
     extension .dcm; i.e., "00001.dcm".

     This perl script calls the program dcm_dump_element from the
     ERL DICOM package.


EXAMPLES
     dcm_slice_reorder 4 131
