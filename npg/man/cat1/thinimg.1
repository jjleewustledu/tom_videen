NAME
     thinimg - erode boundary of an image


SYNOPSIS
     thinimg image npixels


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads any PET image and then sets to  zero  the
     specified number of pixels at the boundaries of the non-zero
     image on each slice.  It is comparable to the "subtract pix-
     els" from a thresholded mask in spideram.

     It might be used in conjunction with  maskpct  to  create  a
     masked  image of a transmission scan and then strip away the
     skull (note that this is approximate as a constant threshold
     will not define the same skull boundary on all slices).

     The output image file will have the same format as the input
     file (e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
