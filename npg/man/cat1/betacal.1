NAME
     betacal - computes beta probe calibration factor

SYNOPSIS
     betacal


DESCRIPTION
     Betacal runs interactively to compute the calibration factor
     to  convert  beta  probe (automated blood sampler) counts to
     well counter counts.  One input file is required (beta probe
     .crt  file  acquired  with O-15 or C-11 sample) and a second
     will be created if it does not exist (.wel file).  Note: crt
     files  created  by the new PC (Feb 25, 2002) have the exten-
     sion .crv.

     The "BETA PROBE TO WELL COUNTER CONVERSION FACTOR" is neces-
     sary  to  processing  all other automate blood sampler files
     (crt/crv) with betadcv.  This number should  be  written  to
     the paper with the well counter calibration samples.


SAMPLE INPUT TO PROMPTS
     When a .wel file already exists and you  wish  to  determine
     the beta probe-to-well counter conversion factor (called the
     well counter conversion multiplier in makedta):

     Enter beta probe calibration filename (.crt or .crv)
          p5999cal.crv   (enter filename with extension)
     Bin width of crv file (sec/bin)?  <    1.00000>
          1         (should read default value from crt file)
     Skip 2 points for 961 calibration files after p5999 (25 Feb 2002)

     [The new PC on the blood sample save  erroneous  values  for
     the  first 2 time bins and should be skipped to get an accu-
     rate estimate of the halflife and  an  accurate  calibration
     factor.  Skipping should make no difference on the older crt
     files.]

     Skip first 2 points? <N>
          y
     Radionuclide? <>
          o         (O or C)
     Well counter counting period (sec)?  <  0.>
          12        (953B should use 10 sec samples)
     Well counter data filename to read (enter return if no well data file exists)
          p5999.wel
     ENTER line, dry, wet, minutes, seconds, counts
          <return>
     Well counter data filename to save
          <return>
      ...

     If the wel file does not exist, you can create one by chang-
     ing the responses to the last 3 prompts:

     Well counter data filename to read (enter return if no well data file exists)
          <return>
     ENTER line, dry, wet, minutes, seconds, counts
