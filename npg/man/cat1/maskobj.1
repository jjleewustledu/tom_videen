NAME
     maskobj - create a masked object in an image (with pixels=1)


SYNOPSIS
     maskobj input output threshold x y z


PARAMETERS
     input     - filename of image to be masked
     output    - filename of output image
     threshold - minimum pixel intensity to include
     x,y,z     - coordinates of one pixel within the object


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads any PET image and sets all  pixels  which
     have  values  >=  threshold value and which are connected to
     the seed pixel [x,y,z] to 1. All other pixel values are  set
     to  0.   This  masked  object image is written to the output
     file.

     The output image file will have the same format as the input
     file (e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).

     If you wish to include 'holes' within the object,  try  run-
     ning maskpct first (to create objects defined by their outer
     boundaries rather than by only those pixels above  a  thres-
     hold). Then run maskobj on this masked image.


EXAMPLE
     The following would create a brain mask which  excludes  the
     nose:

     maskpct p5067ho1_g3.v maskobj.v 40
     maskobj maskobj.v maskobj.v 1 64 64 24
