NAME
     maskshrink - strip pixels from the edges of a masked image


SYNOPSIS
     maskshrink input output #pixels


PARAMETERS
     input    - input filename
     output   - output filename
     #pixels  - number of pixels to remove


DESCRIPTION
     This program strips pixels from the edges of a masked  image
     thereby  shrinking  the  size  of  the  mask  similar to the
     "Shrink Template" option in spideram.  The number of  pixels
     specified will be removed from all outer edges of the image.
     I.e., a 2-pixel shrink will reduce both the height and width
     of the mask by 4 pixels.

     The algorithm works inward from each  of  the  4  edges  and
     zeroes  the  first n pixels found which have values > 0.  It
     is not a general image dilation function and is intended for
     regular, convex objects.

     The output image file will have the same format as the input
     file (e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).


EXAMPLE
