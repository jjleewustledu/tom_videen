NAME
     slicenrm - normalize an Analyze image slice-by-slice


SYNOPSIS
     slicenrm input output min max norm


PARAMETERS
     input   - filename of input image
     output  - filename of output image
     min,max - intensity range of pixels to normalize
     norm    - normalization value (additive)


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads an ANALYZE image and identifies all  pix-
     els  within  each slice which are >= min and <= max. It com-
     putes the mean of these pixels and compare it with the  norm
     value.  If  these differ, the program ADDs the difference to
     each pixel in that slice.

     This masked image is written to the output file  in  ANALYZE
     format.

     The original intent of this program  was  to  eliminate  the
     beam  hardening  effect  from  CT images of the brain suffi-
     ciently to perform semi-automatic segmentation.


EXAMPLE
     slicenrm p5000seg1 p5000seg2 10 75 35
