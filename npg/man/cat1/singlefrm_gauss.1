NAME
     singlefrm_gauss - create filtered,  single-frame  images  in
     Analyze format from dynamic image


SYNOPSIS
     singlefrm_gauss image frames planes cutoff tracer extension

       image     = full path and filename of dynamic image
       frames    = frames to isolate; specified as "1to44"
       planes    = planes to isolate; specified as "1to31"
       cutoff    = cutoff (cycles/cm) for Gaussian filter
       tracer    = tracer name for output files
       extension = file extension to use for output files


DESCRIPTION
     This command script creates filtered, single-frame images in
     Analyze  format from a dynamic image file.  This is a neces-
     sary step prior to running aligndyn.

     The specified planes  of  the  original  dynamic  image  are
     copied    to    a    separate    file    for    each   frame
     (separate_dynframes).  Each  of  these  images  is  filtered
     (gauss)  using  the  specified  filter cutoff.  The filtered
     images are converted to Analyze format (img2analyze) and the
     header minimum is set to 0 (setanamin).

     If a file already exists,  the  processing  steps  for  that
     image are skipped.


EXAMPLE
     singlefrm_gauss /data/m500nmb1.img 1to44 8to20 0.3 mb i
