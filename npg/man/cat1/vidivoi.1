NAME
     vidivoi - creation of VOI objects


DESCRIPTION
     Vidivoi was designed specifically  to  interactively  create
     VOIs by outlining them on transverse and/or coronal sections
     of MR images. It has some similarities with vidi but is lim-
     ited and refined for this particular function.

     Like vidi, vidivoi reads images in PETT  VI,  CTI/ECAT  ver-
     sions  6  and  7,  Analyze, and Interfile formats.  However,
     only a single image is viewed at one  time,  and  transverse
     and  coronal  sections  are  displayed  simultaneously.  The
     image filename may be typed or selected  from  a  scrollable
     list by selecting Get Image->Image.

     Image magnification is selected from the pulldown menu 'Mag-
     nify.'

     Color scales are selectable for either the image or objects.
     The  default color for the image is Linear Greyscale and the
     default for the objects is Rainbow 16 Level.

     All fields in which you can type an entry  (e.g.,  Filename,
     Max  or Min Scale) require entering Return or the entry will
     not be read!

     There are 2 scroll bars. The one on the left  moves  up  and
     down through the transverse sections. The buttons labeled Up
     and Down move a single step at a time.  The bar on the right
     moves  anteriorly  or posteriorly through the image, and the
     buttons below the bar move a single  step  at  a  time.  The
     positions  of the current sections are indicated by the hor-
     izontal line across the display windows.

     Moving the cursor in either  of  the  display  windows  will
     print  the  image  coordinates of the cursor position in the
     main menu box.

     The real work will be performed in the  Edit  menu.  Editing
     may  be  done  on  either  the  transverse or coronal slices
     (select Edit->Transverse or Edit->Coronal). There are 2 pri-
     mary  edit  functions: Fill and Erase. Fill will add all the
     pixels within a traced outline  to  the  currently  selected
     object  number  (1-10).  Erase will remove the traced pixels
     from ALL objects.

     A region is outlined in the selected window  (transverse  or
     coronal)  by  positioning  the cursor over the image in that
     window and depressing the left mouse button.   This  may  be
     depressed   continuously  while  drawing  or  intermittently

     depressed at each sequential pixel  (with  the  intermediate
     pixels filled in automatically). When the Fill or Erase but-
     ton is selected, the outline is completed automatically  and
     the  appropriate  operation occurs. The object number may be
     changed before or after tracing before the  Fill  button  is
     pressed.

     When  you  select  an  object,  the  color  of  the  outline
     representing  that  object  will  appear to the right of the
     numbers.

     By setting the field "Additional Pairs of Planes to Edit" to
     a value other than 0 (remember to type Return after changing
     this number), the Fill operation will apply to  this  number
     of planes on either side of the current one.

     Restore will restore the image to the one preceding the most
     recent edit operation (either Fill or Erase).

     Up and Down move  backwards  or  forwards  in  the  selected
     orientation.

     Exit returns to the Main Menu. None of the buttons  or  bars
     in  the main menu are operable until you exit the Edit Menu,
     however the system will remember all of  your  attempts  and
     execute them later.

     After creating a set of  objects,  you  must  save  them  by
     selecting  Save  Object,  typing in the name of a file (dif-
     ferent from your image  file!)  and  entering  return.   The
     object  file  is  another image file (Interfile format) with
     individual pixels set from 0-10.

     An existing object  file  may  be  read  back  into  vidivoi
     through  Get  Image->Object  or by typing in the name of the
     file. This file may then be further edited.
