NAME
     zptnorm - normalize image intensity in z-dimension


SYNOPSIS
     zptnorm input_image points output_image


DESCRIPTION
     This program computes the voxel intensity at a set of points
     [x,y,z],  fits  a  quadratic  curve  to the intensity vs. Z-
     location, then scales each plane by multiplying  all  pixels
     by  the  mean  intensity  of  all  points divided by the fit
     intensity for each Z-location. The intent  is  to  eliminate
     MPRAGE image non-uniformity in the axial dimension.

     The points file is created with vidi using the 'Points' sub-
     menu.

     The program prompts for the Voxel Radius to be used to  com-
     pute  the intensity at each point. A radius of 0 uses a sin-
     gle voxel (1x1x1); a radius of 1 uses 27 voxels (3x3x3); and
     a radius of 2 uses 125 voxels (5x5x5).

     The corrected image is written  in  Interfile  format.   The
     intensity  values  at all points and the fit intensities are
     saved in a SPED file with the extension 'val.'
