NAME
     tse2analyze - Converts a set of Siemens Turbo Spin  Echo  MR
     image  files  to Analyze and Interfile format (img, hdr, and
     ifh)


SYNOPSIS
     tse2analyze <root1> <seq1> <seq2> <Analyze root>


DESCRIPTION
     tse2analyze is intended to convert a pair of  TSE  sequences
     acquired  as  sets of offset slabs. To convert a pair of TSE
     sequences acquired as interleaved slices, use tsei2analyze.

     tse2analyze  reads  multiple,  sequential  MR  image  files,
     reorients  them  to the 3-D ordering expected by Analyze and
     writes a single image file comprising  all  slices  plus  an
     Analyze  hdr  file  and an Interfile Format header file.  It
     does not change the input  data  except  for  reorientation;
     specifically,  it  does  not  generate  voxels with uniform,
     cubic dimensions.

     The extension "ima" is  assumed  for  all  MR  image  files.
     Turbo  Spin  Echo sequences generate 2 sets of Siemens files
     with separate root names. The sets alternate  with  8  brain
     slices  going  first  to  root1  and  then 8 slices going to
     root2. Tse2analyze sorts these out in creating a single com-
     posite volume.

     The extensions "img", "hdr", and "ifh" are used  for  output
     files.

     The Analyze orientation will match  labels  within  Analyze.
     Note  that  Analyze  thinks  in radiological orientation and
     displays right-on-left (viewing the body from the feet).


NOTES ON ORIENTATION
     While this program is intended to produce output in  a  con-
     sistent  orientation (with transverse sections), it has only
     been tested with MR images  in  View_LtoR  (sagittal).   All
     bets are off for other orientations.


STACKING ORDER
     As of this  writing,  our  standard  head  TurboSE  sequence
     acquires  8  slabs of 8 slices each. If the slabs appear out
     of order, reverse the entry of first and second sequences on
     the command line (as in the example below).
