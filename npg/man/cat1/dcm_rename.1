NAME
     dcm_rename - rename DICOM scans to nnnnn.dcm


SYNOPSIS
     dcm_rename root


DESCRIPTION
     dcm_rename renames all DICOM files beginning with the speci-
     fied  root.  The new filenames are a 5 digit number followed
     by the extension .dcm; i.e., "00001.dcm".  The  ordering  of
     the  numbers  corresponds to the ordering of scan times read
     from the file headers.

     The new file numbers are assigned to the original  filenames
     after  alphabetic sorting of the names. For filenames begin-
     ning with MR or sequence using dcm_slice_reorder.

     The rename commands are saved in the file dcm_rename.log.

     This perl script calls the program dcm_dump_element from the
     ERL DICOM package.


EXAMPLES
     dcm_rename 1.
     dcm_rename MR
