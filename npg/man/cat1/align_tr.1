Name
     align_tr - coregister transmission images from same subject


SYNOPSIS
     align_tr tr1 tr2 mask1 mask2 airfile resample_air
         tr1   = reference transmission image (ECAT format)
         tr2   = reslice transmission image (ECAT format)
         mask1 = mask of tr1 used for fit and to estimate mean
                 pixel shift
         mask2 = mask of tr2
         airfile = output air file
         resample_air = AIR file used to resample images prior
                 to alignlinear


DESCRIPTION
     All input images and masks are in ECAT format. Masks may  be
     created with:

         maskpct m800tr1.img tmp.img 50
         maskimg m800tr1.img tmp.img mask1.img 1
         maskslc mask1.img mask1.img 1to2
         maskslc mask1.img mask1.img 30to31
         rm tmp.img

     and repeating for tr2.  This will threshold to 50%  of  max-
     imum  intensity  (approximately  tissue density on low-noise
     images).

     At least 2 end-planes should be masked out  on  both  images
     using  maskslc.  More importantly, be certain to mask suffi-
     cient slices on each image so that ALL of  the  other  image
     will have corresponding sampled points within the mask. Typ-
     ically, for a difference in z-offset, you  will  mask  addi-
     tional slices at the top of one and the bottom of the other.
     Failure to have sampled  points  within  the  mask  for  the
     corresponding image will cause inaccurate corregistration!

     The estimated mean voxel shift in X, Y and Z dimensions  are
     derived  from  the mean shift of all voxels within the first
     mask.

     The resample_air file is an AIR file created to resample the
     input  image  into a different pixel size in order to remove
     bias due to  pixelization  (see  Andersson,  1998,  and  man
     aligning_dynamic  for more details). There are several stan-
     dard resampling  files  which  have  been  created  (all  in
     /usr/local/npg/air)  which  have  the  corresponding inverse
     transform to restore the pixel dimensions after reslicing.
