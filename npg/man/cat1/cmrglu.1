NAME
     cmrglu - creates a CMRGlucose image from an FDG image

SYNOPSIS
     cmrglu


DESCRIPTION
     cmrglu runs interactively to create a CMRGlucose  image,  an
     hdr file, and a rec file from an FDG image.  A windowed menu
     has fields for all input necessary to create the image.  The
     fields are:

     FDG Image - a single-frame fdg image, typically comprised of
     the sum of late frames of a dynamic acquisition. This may be
     entered directly in the widget field or selected from a list
     by selecting the Input File button.

     Blood Curve - dta file  for  the  FDG  image.  This  may  be
     entered directly in the widget field or selected from a list
     by selecting the DTA File button.

     Output Image - the cmrglucose image which will  be  created.
     If  this file exists, it will be overwritten. A default name
     is created if the input file was selected  using  the  Input
     File  button.  The  default name replaces "fdg" or "fd" with
     "cmrg".

     K1, k2, k3, k4 - FDG rate constants. Note that the units for
     K1  are  ml/g/min  while the units for the others are 1/min.
     To convert k1 in 1/min, divide it by  100  times  the  blood
     volume (ml/100g).

     LC - lumped constant.

     Pie Factor - pie factors are in /usr/local/npg/pie.

     Start - start time of the single-frame  FDG  image  (seconds
     following injection).

     Glucose - blood glucose concentration in micromoles/ml.

     Model - the calculation uses either Huang's  formula:  Am  J
     Physiol  238:E69-E82,  1980,  or Brooks' formula: J Nucl Med
     23:538-539, 1982.

     An IDL license is necessary to run cmrglu. Howver, cmrglu is
     simply  a  front  end  for cmrglucose, which will create the
     image using a single command line.

NOTES
     All IDL fields which take a typed entry MUST have  a  RETURN
     for  the  new value to be read.  You should select the Check
     Values button before to refresh all fields  to  see  if  you
     have properly entered them.

     To create an FDG image from a dynamic image file, first  run
     imgfrms  to  determine  the  number and times of all frames,
     e.g.,
          imgfrms p5296fdg1.v

     Then sum the frames which  cover  the  desired  time  period
     (typically 40-60 minutes), e.g.,
          sumimgframes p5296fdg1.v p5296fdg0.v 38 45

     This particular example creates the single-frame  fdg  image
     p5296fdg0.v  with  a  start  time of 2400 sec (40 min) and a
     duration of 20 minutes.

     The output PET image has pixel values of 1000  *  CMRGlucose
     (ml/min*100g).   Using  the  header  file created by cmrglu,
     spideram will  display  and  calculate  regional  values  in
     proper  units if the processing is selected as "PROCESSED as
     CMRGlucose".

     The value for "Glucose (uMoles/ml)" must be the  SAME  meas-
     urement  as the blood curve (dta file). E.g., they both must
     be either the glucose concentration for plasma or for  whole
     blood.

     Molecular wt of glucose = 180.16 g/Mole
