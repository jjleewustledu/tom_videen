NAME
     smooth3d - 3D spherical filter


SYNOPSIS
     smooth3d infile outfile radius

     where radius is specified in mm.


DESCRIPTION
     smooth3d filters ECAT images by computing the  mean  of  all
     pixels within the specified radius at every pixel. This is a
     similar averaging technique to that  used  in  af3d  and  is
     equivalent  to  placing a spherical VOI at each pixel in the
     original image.

     Unlike af3d, when part of the sphere is not sampled the mean
     will  be  reduced.   I.e., all sums of the smoothing VOI are
     divided by the  same  number  (the  volume  of  the  sphere)
     regardless  of  how  many pixels may have contributed to the
     sum for any particular pixel.   This  causes  edges  of  the
     image  array  to have lower values and has 2 advantages:  1)
     noise does not increase at  edges;  2)  it  is  possible  to
     assess  which pixels were fully sampled by applying the same
     filter to a mask image (in which all brain pixels are set to
     a constant).

VOI Volume for ECAT 961 Images
     For standard EXACT HR images (2.144x2.144x3.275  mm  voxels)
     the following radii produce VOIs with these volumes:
