NAME
     headstart - get visual delay from 961 headcurve


SYNOPSIS
     plotcrv filename


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads a headcurve (.r)  file  and  returns  the
     difference between the time of the first sample from frame 3
     and the first sample from frame 2.  This  gives  the  visual
     delay  (time  from  injection to time of arrival of bolus in
     the head) used by metproc with a maximum error of the sample
     rate of the headcurve.

     Note that this differs from the way  makedta  estimates  the
     visual  delay.  Makedta takes the last time in frame 3, sub-
     tracts 40 seconds, and rounds to an integer. Since 961 head-
     curves  stop  with the end of the third frame, the end point
     is not really the end of the scan  and  therefore  the  time
     estimated  by  makedta  will,  in  general,  be shorter than
     estimated by headstart.

     For 961 data, headstart is the best estimate. For 953B data,
     makedta  is  a  better  estimate as the 953B usually samples
     head counts irregularly around  the  start  of  a  scan  and
     because (currently) no 953B data is collected in the 3-frame
     mode used on the 961 (which is essential for headstart).
