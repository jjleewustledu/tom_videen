NAME
     extractres - filter to extract resources from  a  PostScript
     document

SYNOPSIS
     extractres [ -m ] < _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t._p_s > _o_u_t_p_u_t._p_s

DESCRIPTION
     _E_x_t_r_a_c_t_r_e_s extracts resources  (fonts,  procsets,  patterns,
     files,  etc)  appearing  in  a PostScript document, and puts
     appropriate %%_I_n_c_l_u_d_e_R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e comments in the document  pro-
     logue. The extracted resources are written to files with the
     same name as the resource, and an appropriate extension. The
     pipeline

               extractres file.ps | includeres >out.ps

     will move all resources appearing in a document to the docu-
     ment  prologue,  removing  redundant copies. The output file
     can then be put through page re-arrangement filters such  as
     _p_s_n_u_p or _p_s_t_o_p_s safely.

     The -m option combines the resources of the same  name  into
     one file; this must be used for some programs which download
     fonts a bit at a time.
