NAME
     recon953 - Reconstruct ECAT 953B images


DESCRIPTION
     There are a set of  programs  which  will  reconstruct  953B
     images on any of the Suns (running Solaris 2).

     953B data sets should comprise: stationary and wobbled  nor-
     malization,  blank  and  processed  blank  scan,  at least 1
     transmission  scan  with  processed   log-transmission   and
     attenuation files, and 1 or more emission scans:
          normalsta_020202.nrm
          normalwob_020202.nrm
          020202bl1.scn
          020202bl1.smo
          p3000tr1.atn
          p3000tr1.scn
          p3000tr1l.scn
          p3000ho1.scn
          p3000fdg1.scn

     The blank scans are used only for creating  the  attenuation
     and  log-transmission  files (which must be done on the ECAT
     console, petsun11).

     A transmission image may  be  reconstructed  from  the  log-
     transmission file with:
          recon_2dtr p3000tr1 p3000tr1l 1 0.5 1.875

     If the emission scans were acquired with  gantry  wobble,  a
     wobble  attenuation file must be created from the stationary
     attenuation file:
          makeWobbleAttn p3000tr1.atn p3000tr1_wob.atn

     If a transmission image is forward-projected  to  create  an
     attenuation file (fpattn6), always forward-project to create
     a stationary attenuation  and  then  use  makeWobbleAttn  to
     create the wobble attenuation.

     Emission scans are either stationary or wobbled and acquired
     with  randoms subtracted or saved separately. Each variation
     requires a unique set of processing steps. If  prompts  plus
     delayeds  were acquired (for reduced noise estimates of ran-
     doms), the scan files are first corrected for randoms  using
     rnwproc:
          rnwproc -r -p . p3000ho1.scn

     If multiple scan frames are to be  summed  prior  to  recon-
     struction, use sum_dframes:
          sum_dframes p3000ho1.scn p3000ho1_sum.scn 1 2

User Commands                                         recon953(1)



     Commands for reconstructing stationary or  wobbled,  single-
     frame or dynamic files are:
          recon_2dsta p3000ho1 p3000ho1 p3000tr1 normalsta_020202 1 0.5 2.0
          recon_2dwob p3000ho1 p3000ho1_rn p3000tr1_wob normalwob_020202 1 0.5 2.0
          recon_2dstadyn p3000fdg1 p3000fdg1 p3000tr1 normalsta_020202 1 .5 2.0 7
          recon_2dwobdyn p3000fdg1 p3000fdg1 p3000tr1_wob normalwob_020202 1 .5 2.0 7

     All 2D reconstruction scripts cal bkproj_sun.


3D RECONSTRUCTION
     3D reconstruction is done using recon3d (which is a  wrapper
     for recon3d_scat).
          recon3d p3000fdg1 p3000tr1 020202bl1 020202 2.086 1 44

     If no 3d normalization file exists, it can be created  using
     makenorm_f3d.

     These scripts call the following binaries (John Ollinger):
          arc_corr
          bkproj
          cti_getparam
          extract_summed_planes
          floatmath
          fproj_volume
          import_3dscan_nonorm
          list_sinograms
          makenorm_cti953b
          make_eff_tr_cti953b
          scatcor_cti953b
          sino_2d_extract_cti953b
          which_geo
