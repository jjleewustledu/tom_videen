NAME
     cv7to6 - convert ECAT Version 7 images  to  ECAT  Version  6
     image format


SYNOPSIS
     cv7to6 infile [frame]
     cv7to6 infile outfile frame


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads 1 frame from a version 7 ECAT image  file
     and  writes  a version 6 ECAT VI image file. It thereby per-
     mits compatibility with programs which only read this  older
     format.

     If the program is called  with  either  1  or  2  parameters
     ("cv7to6  infile" or "cv7to6 infile frame"), the filename of
     the input file should be specified without an extension. The
     program will automatically append the extension ".v" for the
     input file and use the same root filename with the extension
     ".img" for the output file.

     If you wish to convert a specified file which does not  have
     the  extension  ".v",  then you must call the program with 3
     parameters ("cv7to6 infile outfile frame").  You  must  give
     the complete filename including extension for both the input
     and output filenames.
