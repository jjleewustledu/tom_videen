NAME
     ecathdr - read the header of an ECAT file and write  a  sum-
     mary of information

SYNOPSIS
     ecathdr filename


DESCRIPTION
     Ecathdr reads the main header and subheader  for  the  first
     slice  (not  necessarily plane 1) of an ECAT image file.  It
     extracts information relevant to the type of  reconstruction
     and filters and writes a summary.

     The  information  includes:   scan  date,  wobble/stationary
     acquisition,  version  of  software  used for reconstruction
     (which affects the pie  factor),  scatter-correction,  pixel
     size,  filter  code,  cutoff,  isotope, and ECAT calibration
     factor (which is also  a  consideration  for  computing  the
     correct  pie  factor), and the comment field (which contains
     SF if the image has been scaled by scaleimage).

     Certain programs which create images will write the  program
     version  (using  ident  to  get the RCS information) and the
     date+time when the image file was created.  This information
     will be displayed by ecathdr.  (see t88mean(1))

     If you attempt to run ecathdr on a non-ECAT file,  you  will
     get a core dump :-(

LOCAL USE of MAIN_HEADER FIELDS
     Three fields in the main_header  (see  matrix.h)  are  being
     used to store special information.

     _p_h_y_s_i_c_i_a_n__n_a_m_e is used by some programs to store information
     about  what  program created the file.  This field will con-
     tain a string of the form:  "Created with: t88mean.c,v  1.78
     1993/10/04  16:"   Note  that  the  time  will be truncated,
     depending on the length of the field.  However, the  version
     number of the program should be unique (see ident(1)).

     _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r__n_a_m_e is used to store the time at which a file  was
     created.  This date stamp should match the date stamp at the
     beginning of the associated rec file  (see  rec(5)).   I.e.,
     "Date: Mon Oct 4 15:34:24 CDT 1993"

     _s_t_u_d_y__d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n is used to store the following information
     about processing (usually in this order):

     whether or not the x-pixel order has been flipped:  if "X:r"
     appears  in the study_description, then it is flipped.  (see
     libpetutil(1)).

     a scale factor inserted by scaleimage  (see  scaleimage(1)):
     "SF: real number".

     processed with a  3-D  filter:   i.e.,  "3D  Gauss"  or  "3D
     Butterworth" (see gauss(1) and butterworth(1)).

     string indicating that a file was created  from  a  PETT  VI
     image (see ecat2pett6(1)):  "Created from PETT VI image"
