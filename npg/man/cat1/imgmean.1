NAME
     imgmean - compute global means for all  scans  in  an  image
     list


SYNOPSIS
     imgmean prm lst [-s] [-t]


DESCRIPTION
     Imgmean computes the global means for  images  in  an  image
     list as identified by a parameter file.

     The parameter _s_l_i_c_e_s determines the  subset  of  slices  for
     which  the  mean  is  computed.   If  it is not defined, all
     slices are used.  If there is no peak slice in the sxr file,
     then  the  peak  used to determine the threshold will be the
     maximum pixel value in the same subset of slices.  If a peak
     slice  is  defined  in the sxr file, then that the threshold
     will be based on the maximum pixel value in that slice  even
     if it is not in the range specified by slices.

     Means are computed on the filtered image  specified  by  the
     parameter  _i_m_g_f_i_l_t_e_r.  Filtered images are no longer created
     by imgmean. If they don't exist, use the  program  filterimg
     to create them.

     Means are computed for those pixels within a mask  specified
     by the parameters:  mskimg, mskpct, and mskfilter (except if
     -s is used, see below).

     Command line parameter -_t will override the parameter _s_l_i_c_e_s
     in  the  parameter  file.  It will therefore determine which
     slices are used in computing the mean brain activity, and it
     will determine the slices searched for the peak pixel if the
     peak slice is not specified in the sxr file.   Example:   -t
     10to20 (the space between "-t" and "10to20" is optional).

     Command line parameter -_s will override the parameter _m_s_k_i_m_g
     in  the parameter file.  The number following -s will be the
     scan number used for the mask.  This image applied as a mask
     using  the  filter  and threshold specified by mskfilter and
     mskpct.  Example: -s 1 (the space between "-s"  and  "1"  is
     optional).

     Images can be processed as  cbf,  cbv,  oef,  cmro2,  tissue
     activity by defining the parameter processing in the parame-
     ter file.

     The parameter _m_s_k_i_m_g may be "control_image", in  which  case
     either  the image file itself is taken for the masking image
     (for a list of single  files)  or  the  control  image  (the

     second  scan  number  in a list of paired files) is used for
     both activation and control scans. The parameter _m_s_k_i_m_g  may
     also be the name of a specific file, in which case that file
     will be used as the mask for all images in  the  image  list
     (as has been done for gba file creation). The general syntax
     is

     mskimg: control_image           # uses control image of each pair
     mskimg: specified p5000ho1_g2.v # one image used for the entire list

     Note that "control_image" and "specified" are  keywords  and
     must  be typed exactly as shown.  The filename p5000ho1_g2.v
     will, obviously, differ.

     If the parameter _m_s_k_f_i_l_t_e_r is defined, then the  image  fil-
     tered  by  mskfilter is used to create the mask.  This image
     is thresholded to the maximum  pixel  in  the  entire  image
     times the value mskpct (multiplied by .01).

     If _v_o_i__o_r_d_e_r: is not specified or  if  it  is  0,  then  PET
     images  are  processed  to metabolic images before computing
     global means.

     If voi_order: 1, then mean global raw  PET  counts  will  be
     computed before computing metabolic values.

     The program will add each computed mean to the  image  list.
     If  a  mean  already  appears  in the image list for a given
     scan, a new mean will not be computed!  This allows a  image
     list  to  be  rapidly  updated when only a few new scans are
     added.  It also allows you to enter mean values computed  in
     some other manner without imgmean recomputing them.  ONLY IF
     a mean value is 0.0 or missing will it be recomputed.


WHICH PEAK IS USED FOR THRESHOLDING?
     The following rules apply in order (i.e., the first success-
     ful one determines the slice):
     1) The peak slice specified in the sxr file (when it is >0).
     2) The maximum pixel value in the slices given by  the  com-
     mand line parameter -_t.
     3) The maximum pixel value in the slices given by the param-
     eter list parameter _s_l_i_c_e_s.
     4) The maximum pixel value in the entire image.


WHICH IMAGE IS USED FOR THRESHOLDING?
     1) The scan number entered on the command line with -_s  This
     image will be filtered according to the parameter _m_s_k_f_i_l_t_e_r
     2) The scan name entered in the parameter list with  parame-
     ter  "mskimg:  specified".  This image will _n_o_t be addition-
     ally filtered (the parameter mskfilter is irrelevant).
