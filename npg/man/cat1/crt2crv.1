NAME
     crt2crv - creates blood curve file from the automatic  blood
     sampler file and the output from headCurve.


SYNOPSIS
     crt2crv bloodcurve headcurve output

     By convention, bloodcurve has extension crt
                    headcurve  has extension plt
                    output     has extension crv


DESCRIPTION
     crt2crv generates blood curve file which is read by betadta.
     betadta creates a dta file which serves as input for metproc
     and fastproc.  crt2crv computes  the  headcurve  using  "Net
     Trues"  (column  5)  and  absolute  scan  time in msec (last
     column) in the plt file. The start  of  the  crt  file  (raw
     blood  curve file) is assumed to coincide with the resetting
     of absolute scan time to 0, which coincides with  the  start
     of data collection.

EXAMPLE
     To illustrate, take p2415ho1.plt. The first bin of  the  plt
     file  (time=11:45:15)  has  no Prompts meaning that the scan
     had not yet begun. The rightmost  column  records  a  gantry
     timer  register  which  increments at 1000 hz. At the end of
     the first bin in  p2415ho1.plt  this  register  read  846133
     msec.   The  scan  start  (time=11:43:33) is signaled by the
     timer count having been reset to 0.   The  first  scan   bin
     lasted  733  msec  and  included 259 Net Trues. The next bin
     lasted 1800 - 733 msec and included 415 Net Trues.   crt2crv
     assigns  head  curve  counts in the crv file by aligning the
     scan start with the begining of the crt (blood sampler) file
     and interpolating Net Trues/bin in the plt file. In p2415ho1
     this rate was about 400/sec at the scan start, Thus  (resam-
     pled)  column  6 in the plt file corresponds column 3 in the
     crv file.

NOTE
     Occasionally, due to operator error, there may  be  no  scan
     start signal, i.e., a resetting of the gantry timer register
     to 0. In that case crt2crv takes the scan start  to  be  the
     begining of the second bin of plt file, this being the first
     bin with a computable duration. A warning  message  to  this
     effect is sent to the screen.

     In data collected prior to the implementation of the  double
     frame  scheme  (mid April 1993, p2247) there is no record of
     absolute scan time in msec and the last column of plt  files
     is  labled  "IPC  Total." In such cases a warning message is

     sent to the screen and crt2crv reconstructs  an  approximate
     head  curve using clock time (column 1) which is recorded to
     the nearest second and Trues/sec (column 6).  The head curve
     start  is  taken  to  coincide with the first bin of the plt
     file.

     Two input files must exist for crt2crv to run:

     1) crt file - blood curve created  by  the  automatic  blood
     sampler;

     2) plt file - scanner activity curve created by headCurve;
