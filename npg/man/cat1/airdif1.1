NAME
     airdif1 - compares the difference between 2 air files


SYNOPSIS
     airdif a.air b.air mask_image


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads 2  air  files  and  computes  the  vector
     difference  between them using pixels with values > 0 in the
     mask_image. This is a version  of  airdif  which  writes  an
     abbreviated output.

     The output is a single line the name of the air file  and  7
     columns of numbers representing:

       airfile  mean x_dist y_dist z_dist x_ang y_ang z_ang.

     Distances are in mm and angles in degrees.

     The mask image must be in ECAT or PETT VI format.
