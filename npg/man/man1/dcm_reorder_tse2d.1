.SH NAME
dcm_reorder_tse2d - reorders dual-echo 2D TSE DICOM scans by echo number and slice position

.SH SYNOPSIS
dcm_reorder_tse2d first last

.SH DESCRIPTION
dcm_reorder_tse2d renumbers the scans between first and last so
that the two echos are separated and slice positions run from
low to high continuously within each echo number. It is used to order
dual-echo 2D TSE sequences.

The filenames must be a 5 digit number followed
by the extension .dcm; i.e., "00001.dcm". 

This perl script calls the program dcm_dump_element from the ERL DICOM package.
