.SH NAME
thinimg - erode boundary of an image

.SH SYNOPSIS

thinimg image npixels

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads any PET image and then sets to zero the specified
number of pixels at the boundaries of the non-zero image on each slice.
It is comparable to the "subtract pixels" from a thresholded mask
in spideram.

It might be used in conjunction with maskpct to create a masked image
of a transmission scan and then strip away the skull (note that this
is approximate as a constant threshold will not define the same skull
boundary on all slices).

The output image file will have the same format as the input file
(e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
