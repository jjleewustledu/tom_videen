.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
vstat imgfile voifile voiname outfile [isotope pieslope]
	imgfile  = dynamic image filename
	voifile  = voi filename
	voiname  = voi name
	outfile  = output filename
	isotope  = f18, c11, o15, ga68, none, test
	pieslope = from piefiles or 1

.EXAMPLES

.SH DESCRIPTION
vstat computes the mean regional activity for all frames of an image
using a single VOI read from a file created using vidi or makevoi.
It is assumed that the voi file was created on a co-registered image
with the same voxel size.

Note that vstat is intended to compute time-activity curves using
irregular vois traced on an MR image whereas voistat is intended to compute
values for regularly-shaped (sphere, cube, cylinder) vois at
1 or more pixel locations. The voi file for vstat contains lists
of individual pixels specifying the boundary whereas a voi file for
voistat contains the x,y,z location of the center of each voi.

When isotope is "none" or missing there will be no decay-correction.
The default for reading all PET images is to convert remove decay correction
if there is a decay-correction factor in the image subheader. Note that when
an image is created in which decay-correction is applied but where the subheader
decay factor is changed to 1, this will not work. 

When isotope is "test" or pieslope=0, the output will be counts/frame with no scaling for frame duration.

When an isotope is named (e.g., f18 or c11), the time-activity curve will be
decay-corrected using the halflife of the named isotope.

If a pieslope is specified, the output should be in (WELLcnts/cc/sec)/(PETcnts/pixel/min).
The pieslope is a linear scaling factor that converts PET counts/pixel/min to well counts/sec/cc.
If your data do not used the well counter (blood samples), the pieslope is irrelevant
except as a common scaler (i.e., output files will be scaled by the pieslope).

Vstat may also be run on single-frame images (with time periods of 0)
by not entering the isotope and pieslope.
This permits processing irregular vidi_voi files on any image and will
compute mean counts per image (no scaling for frame length).

Vstat reads the start time of the first frame of your dynamic file.
It then prompts for "Delay (sec) of first frame from injection?"

If the first image frame began at injection, enter 0.

If the second image frame began at injection and is the first
frame of the reconstructed image, enter the reported start time for
this frame.

Mean_Time is the decay-corrected average time for each frame
computed as:  (-1/tau) * ln(0.5*(exp(-tau*duration)+1))
where tau is the decay constant and duration is the frame duration.
Corrected is mean decay-corrected well counts/ml/sec.
Time is in seconds.
