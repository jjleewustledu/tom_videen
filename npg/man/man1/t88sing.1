.TH T88SING 1 "22-Oct-97" "Neuroimaging Lab"
.SH NAME
t88sing - transform single PETT VI or ECAT images into Talairach 1988 atlas space.  
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B t88sing prm imagelist

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script converts single PET images into single atlas images based on:

Talairach, J. & Tournoux, P. (1988) Co-planar stereotaxic atlas of the human brain. New York: Thieme.

T88sing separates an imagelist into single lists (using /tmp) and then processes these lists to create a set of single images.  Processes either filtered or unfiltered images.  Deletes all temporary files on /tmp.

Imagelists and parameter lists are the same as those used by t88mean.
However, imagelists MUST have each field separated by a SINGLE TAB and
should not have any comment lines

Output filenames are created using the parameter and imagelist files and are always given the extension .t88.

.SH BUGS
Whereas nearly all other programs do not care what kind of "white space" you use
in the imagelist (spaces or tabs), t88sing requires a single tab separating each
field. Also, t88sing does not like comment lines (lines beginning with #).
If you do not have this, you will see the error "set: Syntax error." with
no other explanation.

Also, do not have any blank lines in your file (such as at the end of the list).
