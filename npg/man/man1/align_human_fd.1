.TH ALIGN_HUMAN_FD 1 "05-Jul-2001" "Neuroimaging Lab"

This script will align all frames of an FDOPA dynamic image.
It was written specifically with the following assumptions:
.nf
	30-frame image acquired on 953B;
	injection at start of frame 1;
	significant activity in brain in frame 2;
	reconstruction to 2.086 mm pixels;
	transmission and fd image are in current directory
		with names p????fd1.img and p????tr1.img;
	pixel [64, 64, 16] is within the brain;

The script will:
	create and do all processing in a new directory, Align_pet
	separate all frames;
	use frame 2 as reference frame for alignment;
	use resampling matrices in /usr/local/npg/air,
		scale_953.air and iscale_953.air;
	adjust pixel sizes in those air files if within 1%
		of those in p????fd1.img;
	save all air files, realigned single-frame images, and 
		the realigned 30-frame image in the path, Align;
	creates a file containing amount of correction for each frame;

.fi
Adjacent frames are aligned to each other and the alignment matrices
of all preceding frames are combined to create the alignment matrix
for each frame.

.SH NOTES
You should check the alignment by viewing all frames of at least one brain
slice using vidi and by plotting the frame-by-frame realignment using
plot_aligndyn.

A filtered, composite of frames 1-20 is used to create a mask to estimate the
amount of correction applied to each frame. This mask is also used
by alignlinear (AIR) to determine the voxels used in the cost function.

The script calls several routines, including:
.nf
	airdif
	align_dynamic
	analyze2ecat6
	analyze2img
	fitlog2plt
	gauss2d
	img2analyze
	imgreslice
	maskobj
	merge_dynframes
	newairpix
	remove_dynfiles
	reslicedyn
	saveslc
	separate_dynframes
	setanamin
	single_frames
	sumimgframes

and AIR (3.08) routines:
	alignlinear
	combine_air
	reslice
	scanair
