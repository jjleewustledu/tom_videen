.SH NAME
imgfrms - read headers of all ECAT and PETT VI image files
and report frame start times and durations

.SH SYNOPSIS
imgfrms filename

.SH DESCRIPTION
imgfrms reads all subheaders of a PET file and writes a listing
of frame number, start time and duration (is seconds).
The first reconstructed frame found in the file is assumed to
be the start of the scan and all times are from the beginning of this.

For most of our 961 PET images, the first frame is non-existent and
the injection occurs at frame 2. The error simply indicates that frame 1
was not found and should be ignored.
