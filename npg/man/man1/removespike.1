.SH NAME
removespike - replace central pixel with mean of surrounding ones

.SH SYNOPSIS
removespike infile

.SH DESCRIPTION
removespike will replace an image with one in which the value of central pixel
of each slice (actually x=64,y=65) is replaced with the mean of its 8 surrounding
pixels.

This is a kludge to minimize the worst artifact caused by a defective
memory board on the 961 scanner from p5276-p5311.

.SH EXAMPLE
removespike p5276ho1.v
