.SH SYNOPSIS

threshpct input output threshold [planes]

output    - filename of output image
threshold - percent of maximum pixel count
planes    - slices to mask
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads any PET image, searches for the maximum pixel value
(using the range of slices specified or all slices if not), and then
masks all pixels of the input image which are less then the threshold
in all planes (i.e., sets their values to 0).

The output image file will have the same format as the input file
(e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
