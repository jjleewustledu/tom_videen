.SH NAME
makebmap - generate a map file containing a linear transformation matrix
for baboon brains

.SH SYNOPSIS
makebmap mapfile airfile X Y Z xdim ydim zdim

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program creates a transformation matrix for t88trans (corresponding to the
Davis & Huffman 1968 baboon atlas or 'dh68') using:

an air file generated by the AIR program alignpettomri, alignpettomri16
or alignlinear.
The MR image to which the PET is aligned must first be oriented such that
its planes are parallel to the AC-PC plane.

X, Y, Z are the pixel coordinates of CENTER of the
anterior commissure taken from the MR image to which the PET is aligned.

xdim, ydim, zdim are the brain dimensions in mm measured in the MR image.
xdim is the right-left interputamen distance on the coronal slice
containing the center of the anterior commissure;
ydim is the distance from the center of the AC to the top edge of the PC;
zdim is the average (of left & right) vertical distance between the top of
the caudate nucleus and the bottom of the optic tract, on the 
coronal slice containing the center of the AC.

.nf
The t88 transformation uses atlas brain dimensions of:
     xdim = 19.5 mm
     ydim = 14.5 mm
     zdim = 23.2 mm

and places the atlas origin at (counting from 1):
     X = 64.5 (middle of a 128 array)
     Y = 64.5 (middle of a 128 array)
     Z = 43   (default unless another z0 is specified)

.fi
Note that the atlas origin is 7.0 mm inferior and 21.0 mm posterior to
the anterior commissure in the Davis & Huffman 1968 atlas.

.SH COORDINATES
The coordinates for 'Origins' which appear while makebmap is running
now should correspond exactly to the pixel coordinates which are used
by either Analyze or spideram.  These are:

.nf
Origin defined in Spideram space of atlas image
Origin defined in ANALYZE space of MR image
Origin aligned in ANALYZE space of input PET image
Origin aligned in Spideram space of input PET image
.fi

Analyze and spideram differ as follows (using a 31-slice
PET image with 128x128 pixels per plane):
The center of this image in both spideram and Analyze is [64.5,64.5,16] --
[x,y,z]. The left, anterior, superior corner of the image
(relative to subject) is [1,1,1] in spideram and [128,128,31] in
Analyze (Region of Interest and Oblique Sections).
