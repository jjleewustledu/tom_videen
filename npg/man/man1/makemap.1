.TH MAKEMAP 1 "11-Nov-96" "Neuroimaging Lab"
.SH NAME
makemap - generate a map file containing a linear transformation matrix
for t88trans or t88trsing

.SH SYNOPSIS
makemap mapfile airfile X Y Z xdim ydim zdim

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program creates a transformation matrix for t88trans using:

an air file generated by the AIR program alignpettomri or alignpettomri16.
The MR image to which the PET is aligned must first be oriented such that
its planes are parallel to the AC-PC plane.

X, Y, Z are the pixel coordinates of the 1988 Talairach origin (the superior, posterior
edge of the anterior commissure) taken from the MR image to which the PET is aligned.

xdim, ydim, zdim are the brain dimensions (in pixels) measured in the MR image.
xdim is the right-left dimension (pixels) of the brain in the ACPC plane.
ydim is the anterior-posterior dimension (pixels) of the brain in the ACPC plane.
zdim is the distance (planes) from the ACPC plane to the top of the brain (the greatest
distance, which, in general, is not measured from the anterior commissure).

.nf
The t88 transformation uses atlas brain dimensions of:
     xdim = 135 mm
     ydim = 172 mm
     zdim =  74 mm

and places the atlas origin at (counting from 1):
     X = 64.5 (middle of a 128 array)
     Y = 64.5 (middle of a 128 array)
     Z = 31   (default unless another z0 is specified)

.SH COORDINATES
The coordinates for 'Origins' which appear while makebmap is running
now should correspond exactly to the pixel coordinates which are used
by either Analyze or spideram.  These are:
 
.nf
Origin defined in Spideram space of atlas image
Origin defined in ANALYZE space of MR image
Origin aligned in ANALYZE space of input PET image
Origin aligned in Spideram space of input PET image
.fi
 
Analyze and spideram differ as follows (using a 47-slice
PET image with 128x128 pixels per plane):
The center of this image in both spideram and Analyze is [64.5,64.5,24] --
[x,y,z]. The left, anterior, superior corner of the image
(relative to subject) is [1,1,1] in spideram and [128,128,47] in
Analyze (Region of Interest and Oblique Sections).
