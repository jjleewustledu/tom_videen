.SH NAME
zptnorm - normalize image intensity in z-dimension

.SH SYNOPSIS
zptnorm input_image points output_image

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program computes the voxel intensity at a set of points [x,y,z],
fits a quadratic curve to the intensity vs. Z-location, then scales
each plane by multiplying all pixels by the mean intensity of all points
divided by the fit intensity for each Z-location. The intent is to
eliminate MPRAGE image non-uniformity in the axial dimension.

The points file is created with vidi using the 'Points' submenu.

The program prompts for the Voxel Radius to be used to compute the
intensity at each point. A radius of 0 uses a single voxel (1x1x1);
a radius of 1 uses 27 voxels (3x3x3); and a radius of 2 uses 125 voxels (5x5x5).

The corrected image is written in Interfile format.
The intensity values at all points and the fit intensities are saved in
a SPED file with the extension 'val.'
