.TH CMRGLUCOSE 1 "30-Jul-2008" "Neuroimaging Lab"
.SH NAME
cmrglucose - creates a CMRGlucose image from an fdg image
.SH SYNOPSIS
cmrglucose img dta K1 k2 k3 k4 lc glucose pie t0 model out

.SH PARAMETERS
.nf
img - single-frame fdg image (sum of late frames);

dta - fdg blood curve (dta file);

K1, k2, k3, k4 - rate constants;
	units for k2, k3, k4 are 1/min
	units for K1 are ml/g/min (K1 = k1 * CBV/100)

if these are obtained from Joanne's program, they will be:
	k1 = K-21 * BLOOD VOL / 100
	k2 = K-12/K-02
	k3 = K-32
	k4 = K-23

lc - lumped constant

glucose - blood glucose concentration (microMoles/ml)
	must agree with the value in dta file;
	e.g., both must be either plasma or whole blood conc
	(molecular wt of glucose = 180.16 g/Mole)

pie - pie factor (pie files are in /usr/local/npg/pie)

t0 - sec after injection for start img

model 0 = Huang's formula: Am J Physiol 238:E69-E82, 1980
      1 = Brooks' formula: J Nucl Med 23:538-539, 1982

out - CMRGlucose image

.SH NOTES
CMRGlucose image has pixel values of 1000 * (ml/100g/min).
Using the header file created by cmrglucose, spideram will display and calculate
regional values in proper units if the processing is selected as
"PROCESSED as CMRGlucose". However, values from imgmean must
be multiplied by 0.001.

Note: Molecular wt of glucose = 180.16 g/Mole

Use 5.5506 uM/g to convert output to micromol/100g/min

cmrglu is an IDL front end for cmrglucose which permits interactive
entry of all parameters.

To create an fdg image from a dynamic image file, first run imgfrms to
determine the number and times of all frames, e.g.,
.nf
	imgfrms p5296fdg1.v

.fi
Then sum the frames which cover the desired time period, e.g.,
.nf
	sumimgframes p5296fdg1.v p5296fdg0.v 42 47

.fi
This particular example creates the single-frame fdg image p5296fdg0.v with a start
time of 2880 sec (48 min) and a duration of 18 minutes.
