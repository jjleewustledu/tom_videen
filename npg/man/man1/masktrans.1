.SH NAME
masktrans - mask a transmission image to 'brain'

.SH SYNOPSIS

masktrans filename

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script calls 3 programs: (1) maskbars to remove the headholder bars
from a transmission image; (2) maskpctslice to threshold the image to 60%
of each slice maximum; (3) maskshrink to strip 2 pixels off all edges
of the remaining image.  The resulting image has thresholded
dimensions which approximately correspond to the brain.

The output image is intended as input to xray where a trim of 0 should
be specified and which will effectively remove another 0.5 pixel from
all edges of the brain. xray should be called using a threshold of 60
(actually anything between 1-60 should be equivalent), peaktype of 1
and trim of 0.
This dimension corresponds fairly well to that of
a set of MR brain dimensions measured near the AC-PC plane.

The output image file will have the same format as the input file
(e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
