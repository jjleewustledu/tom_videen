.SH NAME
metcalc_pvc_hemi - compute CBF, CBV, OEF, CMRO2 from counts and hdrs

.SH SYNOPSIS
metcalc_pvc_hemi datafile

.SH DESCRIPTION
metcalc_pvc_hemi computes global, left and right hemispheric
CBF, CBV, OEF, and CMRO2 from regional PET counts from a spideram output file.

The spideram file is the output from Global Averaging run as
"Whole Slice plus Right/Left Hemispheres" on 4 images (all masked to
tissue and all with the same high resolution). These are run twice
(processing as PET counts) first using a large whole-brain mask
generated by spideram (templating in Display section) and then
using a smaller mask (creating by stripping additional pixels
from the first mask.

The order of processing is fixed and assumed to be:
.nf
	A) Larger masked volume
		1) ho
		2) oc
		3) oo
		4) tis
	B) Smaller masked volume
		5) ho
		6) oc
		7) oo
		8) tis

.fi
metcalc_pvc_hemi first creates a .sum file which contains only the
global summary values from the input file. It then reads the hdr file
names, mean counts (global, left, right) and pixels for each processed
image and computes the partial volume corrected mean cbf, cbv, oef
and cmro2 for global, left and right hemispheres.
