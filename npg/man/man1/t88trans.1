.TH T88TRANS 1 "30-Sep-96" "Neuroimaging Lab"
.SH NAME
t88trans - transform PETT VI or ECAT images into Talairach 1988 atlas space
using a map file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B t88trans prm lst output.t88

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program converts PET images into atlas images based on:

Talairach, J. & Tournoux, P. (1988) Co-planar stereotaxic atlas of the human brain. New York: Thieme.

It uses a linear transformation which is read from a map file.  At this time,
map files may be generated by makemap using an air file which, in turn, is
generated by AIR alignment of a PET image to an MR image.

.SH IMAGELIST FILE

The imagelist has the same format as imagelists for t88mean except
that map files are read instead of sxr files.  At this time, map files
must be in your current directory (archive library routines will not
search for them).  If a map file has the form "p5000.map", then nothing
additional need appear in the imagelist file. However, if characters
other than the species, subject id and extension .map are used, the additional
characters plus extension must appear at the end of the line in the imagelist.
E.g., to use the file p5000top.map, the string "top.map" must appear in the
imagelist.

The imagelist must contain normalization values.  If you do not want
to normalize, set these values equal to the same number you use for the
parameter "smg_norm" in the prm file.

.SH PRM FILE

The following keywords are read from the prm file.  Files can be located in the
local directory, a specified directory 'datapath', /tmp, or the archive. 
Examples are given for each parameter, but all allowed values are given only for
those parameters unique to t88trans.

# Optional parameters which influence the processing by t88trans:

smg_mask:         yes       # default is no
smg_nimage:       yes       # default is no
smg_sdimage:      yes       # default is no
pixel_size:       0.260777  # in cm (default is the value read from input image file)
plane_separation: 0.3375    # in cm (default is the value read from input image file)
slices:           6to26     # default is all;  range of raw PET slices to include
z0:               41        # default is 31
zmax:             75        # default is 49
atlas:            dh68      # default it t88 (dh68 is baboon atlas)
.fi

The optional parameters pixel_size and plane_separation will force these to be
used as the dimensions of all PET images which are read.  These are necessary
to process 953 images which have been converted to PETT VI format (e.g., with difgen). 
Normally, if t88trans reads an image and finds it in PETT VI format, it uses
the standard dimensions of 0.286 cm pixels and 1.44 cm slice separation
(there are no pixel dimensions in PETT VI headers).

smg_included has 3 options.  "all" specifies that all pixels will be included
in the output image. "sampled" specifies that only fully sampled pixels
(all subjects contribute) will be included in the output image. "n=10"
specifies that the output image will only have non-zero pixels where at
least 10 subjects contributed to the pixel; furthermore, the option 
smg_included: n=10" is specified, the divisor will always be local regardless
of what is named for smg_divisor.

Note that "smg_included: n=10" will include only those pixels for which total weight >= 10.
If the weighting factors are all 1.0 or if no weighting factors appear in the image list,
then this is the same as including all pixels which were sampled by at least 10 scans.

.nf
smg_divisor has 3 options:

global - divide the output image by the total weights
   for the entire input list (global max).
 
local  - divide the output image by the total weight
   contributing to each pixel (local max).
 
none   - do not divide the output image.
   This allows, say, a weight of .25 to produce a "t88sing"
   output image which is normalized to 250 instead of 1000.
.fi

Note that weights are always relative to the rest of the list.
If you have 10 scans and assign them all a weight of 0.5,
t88trans will compute the same image as would be obtained if all the weights
were 1.0 (assuming that
you are not masking by weights, i.e., that you have "smg_included: all").

For ECAT image files, the pixel_size and plane_separation are read from the file
header. For PETT VI format files, it is assumed that pixel_size = 0.286 cm and
plane_separation = 1.44 cm.  If these values are incorrect (which they will be
if an ECAT image has been rewritten in PETT VI format, e.g., difgen), then you
must specify these two parameters with their proper values.  If you are uncertain
about pixel size, run ecathdr on one of your original images.  Typical values
for ECAT images are:

.nf
	0.208621  (standard 2D ecat images zoomed 2.0)
	0.260777  (old 2D ecat images zoomed 1.5)
	0.208621  (standard 3D ecat images; or 2D images zoomed 1.875)
.fi

The optional parameter "slices" will restrict the range of raw PET slices which will be
included in the sampled image space.  For example, including the line

	slices:	6to26

in your prm file (for ecat images) will cause all data in slices 1-5 and 27-31
to be ignored by t88trans.  This differs from what you get
if you simply mask the raw images before t88trans, in which case
t88trans would interpret the data as sampled with zero activity.
It is the same as using a separate msk image for each raw image
in t88trans.  If the slices parameter is missing, then all slices are included.
Note that slices is applied to the input images and not the output image.

If the parameter "datapath" is specified, that will be the first
location searched for all input files.  Files which are created (smg,
rec, etc.) will still appear in you local directory).

See examples below for minimal prm files for some typical data sets.

.SH ALGORITHM
The transformation requires a map file which contains the linear transformation matrix
used to determine the PET coordinate corresponding to each atlas coordinate.
This map file may be created with the program makemap.

If smg_sdimage = yes, an image representing the unbiased estimate of standard
deviation is computed and stored with the extension .sd.  For these images,
each pixel is computed as:

.nf
  if (n > 1 and sumsqrs > 0) then
    pixel = sqrt ((sumsqrs - ((sum * sum) / n)) / (n - 1));
  else
    pixel = 0;

where:

  n = number of individual scans (or scan pairs) contributing
      to each pixel;
  sum = sum of the pixel values (or pixel differences);
  sumsqrs = sum of the squares of the pixel values (or sum of
      the pixel differences squared);
  sqrt = square root operation;
.fi

Therefore, the standard error of the mean (or standard error of the mean
difference) would be computed by dividing each pixel in the sd image by sqrt(n).
