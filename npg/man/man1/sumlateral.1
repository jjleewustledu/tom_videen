.SH NAME
sumlateral - creates a lateral projection of an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sumlateral infile outfile [min max]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Sumlateral adds all sagittal planes of an image and creates a
single-plane image. The central plane is marked with a short line
at each end using the maximum pixel intensity.
The threshold and limit may be used to limit the range of values
which will are summed in the projection.

This program may be used to create a lateral projection of a
transmission image to compare with the lateral x-ray.
In this case, limits of 1100 and 1250 work reasonably well.

PETT VI and ECAT image (versions 6 & 7) file formats are supported.
