.SH NAME
gauss - filters ECAT 953B, 961 or 962 images with a 3D Gaussian filter

.SH SYNOPSIS
gauss infile [outfile] half_freq

.SH DESCRIPTION
gauss filters ECAT 953B and 961 images (and PETT VI if you really want)
using a Gaussian filter with the specified half-frequency in all 3 dimensions.
For the filtered image to be interpretable, the input image should have
been reconstructed with a ramp filter with cutoff at the Nyquist frequency.

The output filename is optional; if not specified, a common default
name is created.
A recfile will be created.

.SH PARAMETERS
.nf
infile    - input image filename
outfile   - output filename (optional)
half_freq - half frequency (cycles/cm)

.SH RESOLUTION OF FILTERED 953B IMAGES
For images reconstructed with ramp filter and then processed by gauss.
The resolutions were measured on a line source in air and represent the central
11 slices of a 31-slice image.  Resolution for 3-D images is greater in the end
slices.  [Round all of these to the nearest 1/2 cm for citations.]

.SH RESOLUTION OF FILTERED 961 IMAGES
For images reconstructed with ramp filter and scatter-correction and then processed by gauss.
The resolutions were measured on a line source in water and in air, positioned
approximately 1 cm from the center of the aperture. FWHM represents the central
25 slices of a 47-slice image. While resolution for 2-D images is constant through
all 47 slices, Resolution for 3-D images is significantly greater in the end slices
(less than slice 12 or greater than slice 36 for images with no axial smoothing).
Measured resolution in water is slightly better than in air, probably because the
needled used in air was larger than the capillary tubes used in water.

.SH RECONSTRUCTION WITH 7.2.2 (after 7/1/2007) vs 7.1 SOFTWARE
For visually comparable images, filter the older (7.1) images with gauss 1.8.
