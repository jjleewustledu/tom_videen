dcm_reorder_ep - reorders dual-acquisition EP DICOM scans by acquisition name and slice order

.SH DESCRIPTION
dcm_reorder_ep renumbers the scans between first and last so
that the two acquisitions are separated and slice positions run from
low to high continuously within each echo number. It is used to order
EPFID sequences.

The filenames must be a 5 digit number followed
by the extension .dcm; i.e., "00001.dcm". 

This perl script calls the program dcm_dump_element from the ERL DICOM package.
