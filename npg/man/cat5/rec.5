REC(5)             Headers, Tables, and Macros             REC(5)



NAME
     rec - image record file

DESCRIPTION
     Each rec file contains information about  the  programs  and
     commands used to create or modify an image file.


NAMING CONVENTION
     The extension ".rec" is appended to the image file name

       image file = mydata.smg
       rec file   = mydata.smg.rec


SYNTAX
     Rec files consist of nested blocks of the form:

       rec
       endrec

     Each program which creates an image file or alters an exist-
     ing one will create a rec file which begins with the line:

     rec <image_file_name> <date> <user_id>

     where:
       image_file_name = file name without path
       date = date and time; (also inserted in the image file header)
       user_id

     The same date + time will  be  written  to  the  image  file
     header as a check that an image and rec file correspond.

     The second line will be the command line  which  created  or
     modified  the  image  file  (i.e,  the  program name and the
     parameters passed).

     If a parameter list (see prm (5)) is included in the  input,
     it will appear next in a block of the form:

       prm
       endprm

     with the parameter list copied between these two lines.

     If an image list (see imagelist  (5))  is  included  in  the
     input, it can appear next in a block of the form:

       list
       endlist

     If the program reads any other image files, then  their  rec
     files  will  be added to the list (appended directly as they
     are read).  If an image is read and no rec  file  is  found,
     the line

       filename.rec not found

     will be added to the output rec file.

     Other information in the  rec  file  will  include  anything
     which  the  program  may  measure  or compute that is deemed
     worth saving (i.e., transformation matrices, conversion fac-
     tors, etc).

     Redundancy may be reduced either by  the  program  or  by  a
     separate redundancy-eliminator program by eliminating refer-
     ences to certain parameter keywords which appear in the ini-
     tial  prm-endprm  block  which might appear in any rec files
     read and appended by the program.  The  parameters  screened
     would  include  any which required the input to be of a par-
     ticular type but exclude any parameters which indicated that
     the particular value should be ignored.
