NAME
     imagespace - descriptions of various coordinate systems


PET SPACE
     Array  a[k][j][i]  as  read   by   local   software   (i.e.,
     getrealimg) where:
       k = 1 to nslices
       j = 1 to 128
       i = 1 to 128

     array origin:
       k = 1
       j = 1
       i = 1

     righthanded coordinate system:
       positive k = ventral
       positive j = posterior
       positive i = right

     Note that in all these descriptions,  the  indexing  of  the
     array space is relative.  All definitions here begin with 1,
     but all indexing in C functions begins with  0.   Particular
     attention  should  be made to this when mixing C and Fortran
     code.


ATLAS SPACE
     Coordinate system used for reporting data.  Based on  either
     Talairach  et  al  (1967)  hd6 brain or Talairach & Tournoux
     (1988) brain atlas.  These two atlases differ in  the  sizes
     and  shapes  of  the brain as well as the positioning of the
     origin.  In addition, local software to convert to these two
     spaces  has used slightly different transformations (see TOV
     for definitions of SARP and hd6 space; see t88mean  (1)  for
     definition of t88 space).

     Data are stored in 49-slice image arrays, a[k][j][i] where:
       k = 1 to 49     z =  60 to  -36 mm
       j = 1 to 128    y = 127 to -127 mm
       i = 1 to 128    x = 127 to -127 mm

     atlas array origin:
       k = 31           z = 0
       j = 64.5         y = 0
       i = 64.5         x = 0

     lefthanded coordinate system:
       positive z = dorsal
       positive y = anterior
       positive x = left

STEREOTAXIC-IMAGE SPACE
     Atlas space as handled internally by software.  The array is
     equivalent  to atlas space and is transformed to atlas-space
     by a shift of origin plus a sign reversal on all 3 axes.

     Array a[k][j][i] where:
       k = 1 to 49
       j = 1 to 128
       i = 1 to 128

     array origin:
       k = 1
       j = 1
       i = 1

     righthanded coordinate system:
     (angle signs conform to righthanded rule)
       positive z = ventral
       positive y = posterior
       positive x = right

     Coordinate transformation with order of rotation: X,  Y,  Z.
     Computed  PET  coordinates  (xp,  yp,  zp)  corresponding to
     stereotaxic coordinates (xs, ys, zs)

     angle X:
         positive -> PET head is tilted backward
           (this sign is the opposite of anglex in the sxr file!)
           y rotates toward z

         yp = ys*cos(X) + zs*sin(X)
         zp = zs*cos(X) - ys*sin(X)

     angle Y:
         positive -> PET head is tilted to left
           (right ear dorsal to left ear)
           z rotates toward x

         xp = xs*cos(Y) - zs*sin(Y)
         zp = zs*cos(Y) + xs*sin(Y)

     angle Z:
         positive -> PET head is rotated to left
           (right ear anterior to left ear)
           y rotates toward x

         xp = xs*cos(Z) + ys*sin(Z)
         yp = ys*cos(Z) - xs*sin(Z)


MAT FILE
     Coordinates in .mat files based reference values from rmsimg

     (imgroto, grprms).

     array origin:
       z = 1 (1-nslices)
       y = 1 (1-128)
       x = 1 (1-128)

     righthanded coordinate system:
     (angles are a mix of left- and righthanded rules)
       positive z = ventral
       positive y = posterior
       positive x = right

     Coordinate transformation with order of rotation: X,  Y,  Z.
     Computed  PET  coordinates (xp, yp, zp) corresponding to the
     aligned coordinates (xa, ya, za)

     angle X:
         positive -> misaligned PET is tilted downward
           z rotates toward y

     angle Y:
         positive -> misaligned PET is tilted to left
           (right ear dorsal to left ear)
           z rotates toward x

     angle Z:
         positive -> misaligned PET is rotated to right
           (left ear anterior to right ear)
           x rotates toward y
