NAME
     vidi_voi - volume-of-interest file for vidi


DESCRIPTION
     A voi file contains the definitions  of  volumes-of-interest
     in  image  space.   Four  types of VOI definitions are used:
     circle, rectangle, trace and threshold.

     Planes and frames are indexed  from  1  while  pixel  x,  y-
     coordinates  are indexed from 0.  Hence, for a 128x128 image
     with multiple planes and frames, the  exact  center  of  the
     first plane of the first frame will be defined by:
          frame = 1
          plane = 1
          x = 63.5
          y = 63.5

     The location in brain-space of plane=1 and x,y=(0,0) will be
     at the left, anterior, superior corner of the image volume.

     Note that for VOIs drawn as outlines (circle, rectangle  and
     trace),  the  thin  line  drawn  on the image appears at the
     lower or right side of a pixel when  the  image  is  zoomed.
     For  VOIs  defined by thresholds, the entire pixel is filled
     in.

     Within each VOI file, all VOIs with the same  name  MUST  be
     grouped  together  and ordered sequentially by slice number.
     Files created by vidi will be sorted.


SEE ALSO
     Voi files with this format may be used with vstat.
