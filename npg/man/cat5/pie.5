NAME
     piefile - calibration factors for PET images


DESCRIPTION
     A pie file is necessary to convert PET images  to  metabolic
     images.

     The name "pie" is derived from the  shape  of  the  original
     calibration  phantom--a  6-part  cylinder.   In recent years
     pies have been calculated using a uniform cylindrical  phan-
     tom.


USING PETT VI PIE FILES
     For PETT VI images, there are multiple pie files which  must
     correspond  in  date  and type (hi or low resolution) to the
     images you are working with.  These files typically have 3-5
     conversion  factors, each one for a particular counting rate
     or "bankpair" as PETT VI never had a deadtime correction.


USING ECAT PIE FILES
     For ECAT images,  there  is  a  single  pie  file  which  is
     adjusted for the images you are working with. The ECAT cali-
     bration or .pie file  was  computed  from  a  2D  stationary
     acquisition  (C-11) reconstructed with all corrections (ran-
     doms, deadtime,  measured  attenuation  and  scatter).   The
     images  were  reconstructed with the factory release version
     6.4C software using normalization files generated  with  the
     same  software.  The factor is constant over activity levels
     ( >15 mCi in 20-cm phantom) and over time.

     The  conversion   factor,   5.4418   (wellcounts/ml/sec)   /
     (ECATcounts/pixel/min),  must  be  altered for images recon-
     structed differently.  In particular, the factor  should  be
     multiplied by the following factors where they differ:


          wobbled acquisition      2.0    (wobble speed > 0)
          nrm from older software  0.891  (<=6.4C alpha or < Apr 12, 1993)
          no scatter correction    0.893  (filter parameters 5,6 = 0)

     The factors should be combined for all conditions which  are
     true  Scatter correction adjustment is approximate and based
     on the 20-cm uniform phantom.  The correction for  old  .nrm
     files  is  the  branching factor for Ga-68 used in the solid
     phantom during normalization.

     The function getpie called in metproc and petproc will  read
     the  ECAT  file  headers,  guess the file type, and derive a
     factor using the following rules. The function will tell you

     when it alters the factor in the pie file.


          factor = value from pie file
          if (wobble_speed > 0)  factor = 2.0 * factor
          if (scan_date < 19 Feb 93)  factor = 0.891 * factor
          if (filter_parm(5) = 0 and filter_parm(6) = 0)  factor = 0.893 * factor

     Changes in treating the branching factor appear in 6.4C fac-
     tory  (tape  dated  Mar 17, installed Apr 12, next subject =
     p2245) and not 6.4C alpha (installed Feb 19).

     With the change from 6.4C alpha to 6.4C factory,  2  changes
     appear in the headers:

          1) ECAT_calibration_factor changed from 1.0000 (we calibrate to ECAT counts)
          2) filter_code for ramp filter changed from 1 to -1 (but we changed some of
             the headers before we realized that this was not a CTI bug)

3D 953B IMAGE PIES
     All quantitative 3-D images from the  953B  are  assumed  to
     have   been  reconstructed  with  John  Ollinger's  scatter-
     correction. These images were normalized to  have  the  same
     image pixel counts per activity as scatter-corrected wobbled
     images. Hence, the pie factor should be  identical  to  that
     for  wobbled  images  (there are no 3D images prior to April
     1993 and all 3D images are assumed to  be  scatter-corrected
     if  a piefile is read).  3D images are recognized by a value
     of 1.0 for filter_params[0] in the CTI subheader (2D  images
     have 0.5 or 0.25).


ECAT Counts to Well Counts
     Well      = wellcounts/ml/sec
     ECAT      = PET counts/pixel
     Time      = PET frame duration (min)
     PieSlope  = Pie Slope (wellcounts/ml)/(ECATcounts/pixel)
     PieFactor = PETT Conversion Factor = pieslope * 60
                 (wellcounts/ml/sec)/(ECATcounts/pixel/min)

     Well = ECAT * Time * PieFactor
