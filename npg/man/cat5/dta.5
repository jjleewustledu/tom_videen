NAME
     dta - blood curve data file


DESCRIPTION
     dta files are used by metproc  and  petproc  to  create  hdr
     files.   The  hdr  files are necessary to process or display
     PET images as metabolic images.  Dta files  are  created  by
     blood,  betadta,  or  fastdta.   Each  dta  file may contain
     information about 1 or more scans.

     First 4 lines of file  (written by main program):
       (The second and third lines are column headers for the blood points)
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     @01@ Header                                        (A5,A69)
            Corrected   Syringe Weight      Sample Time    Measured   Per

     No. of Blood Curves                                (I)


     For each blood curve:
     --------------------

     Type of Scan                Scan ID                            (I1,1X,A4)
     Start Time (sec)            Scan Length (sec)                  (2F9.0)
     Peak Bank Pairs (thousands)                                    (F10.4)
     Oxygen Content (ml/ml)      Hematocrit (percent)               (2F10.4)
     Number of Blood Points                                         (I)
     Corrected Time, Corrected Counts, Dry Wt, Wet Wt, Sample Time,
        Count Time, Counts, Count Period                            (6F,I,F)
           .
           .
           .

     Notes:
     -----

     1) Corrected Time = sample time (seconds after injection; shifted);

     2) Corrected Counts = decay corrected well counts/(ml * sec);
           Decay correction is to the time of injection;
           Conversion is from counts/(g * t sec) to counts/(ml * sec);
           (using density of whole blood or plasma, as appropriate).
           (t is the period given in the last column)

     3) For SCANTYPE = 1, if the hematocrit is not 0, then the last point
           in the blood curve is the well counts for plasma taken from the
           same sample as the whole blood in the next to last point.

     4) Scan ID is the last 3-4 characters of the scan file name;
           e.g., for p1000ho1.img, the scan ID would be ho1

     5) Scan Types:
           1 = O-15 Oxygen Metabolism Study  (OO)
           2 = O-15 Water Blood Flow Study   (HO)
           3 = O-15 Blood Volume Study       (CO)
           4 = C-11 Butanol Blood Flow Study (BU)
           5 = F-18 Study
           6 = Misc. Study

     6) Peak Bank Pairs is read off the scanner by the operator during
           the scan, and is a measure of the counting rate of the scanner.
           This information is used for PETT VI images only.  It has no effect
           on processing for ECAT images.
