NAME
     prm - parameter file

DESCRIPTION
     The prm file is used by programs to  set  various  parameter
     values  used  by  many of our programs.  The file contains a
     one line entry for each parameter, of the form:
        "key: value[, value] ..."

     The key is a character string ending with a colon  and  fol-
     lowed  by  white space (any number of spaces or tabs).  If a
     key is not used or recognized by a program, it  is  ignored.
     There are three special cases for value:
         -      => ignore this parameter
         true   => enable the parameter corresponding to key
         false  => disable the parameter corresponding to key

     Comments may appear on any line  and  are  identified  by  a
     leading  pound  (#)  character.   Comments continue from the
     left most pound symbol to the end of the line, i.e.,

         # a comment line
         key1:  value # a comment following a parameter
         #key2: value # this key is disabled by the first #

     Blank lines may appear anywhere in the file.


KEYS for EXPANDING FILENAMES
     The general form for 'standard' and 'diff' imgmodes is:

     <species><id><tracer><scan_number><suffix><filter_suffix><extension>

     where the id and scan_number are read from the imagelist and
     all  other  parameters  are  read  from  the  prm file.  See
     imagelist(5) for other examples.



     datapath:
          Search this first (before ., /tmp, or the archive).


     species:  (any string)
          p
          m


     tracer:   (any string)
          ho
          co
          oo
