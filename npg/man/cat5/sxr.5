NAME
     sxr - skull xray file format


DESCRIPTION
     sxr files are created by the program xray (1). The following
     is a line by line explanation for the sxr file format.

     Line 1: sxr file version and program version
             TYPE      22 {created by xray version 3.2}

     Line 2: Header (arbitrary character string)
             p2176.sxr; 50% scan peak template of p2176ho1.
             slices 1-31; 2/10/93; ty7777

     Line 3: PET scan number      p2176

     Line 4: Variable names and sample

       PIX  MF  NSLICES  SLCSIZE  REFSLICE  ZATLDIM  APATLDIM
       FILM_POS  SCAN_POS  OFFSET  PEAKSLICE  XSCALE

       0.261 0.960 31 0.338 16 7.00 16.30 0.0 352.8 0.0 12 0.95

       PIX:      pixel size (cm / pixel).
       MF:       magnification factor for the skull xray (cm).
       NSLICES:  number of slices in tomographics system.
       SLCSIZE:  PET slice separation (cm).
       REFSLICE: reference slice number.
       ZATLDIM:  the vertical dimension from the center of AC-PC
                 in atlas (cm).
       APATLDIM: length of the AC-PC in the atlas (cm).
       FILM_POS: film position (mm), used for ECAT images.
       SCAN_POS: scan position (mm), used for ECAT images.
       OFFSET:   the OFFSET (mm) is the axial difference between
                 slice 16 and the lead line on the xray. For ECAT
                 images created before September, 1994,
                 offset = scan_pos - film_pos - 352.8.
       PEAKSLICE:slice whose peak is used to define the threshold
                 value.
       XSCALE:   xscale factor, computed by t88mean (1).

       APXRAY:   length of the AC-PC line on the skull xray (cm).
       DEGX:     angle between a PET slice and the AC-PC line
                 (degree).
       ZXRAY:    distance from the center of the AC-PC to the

                 vertex of the skull xray (cm).
       DZ:       distance from the center of the AC-PC line to
                 the reference slice using a line perpendicular
                 to the reference slice (cm).
       DAP:      distance from the A-P center of the reference
                 slice to the point where the line perpendicular
                 to the reference slice to the center of the
                 AC-PC line intersects slice 3 (cm).
       APCTR:    center coordinate of the AP axis for the
                 reference slice.
       EARSEP:   R-L separation of the ear markers (cm).

         41.0    67.5      48.0       13.5

       RLPETDIM: R-L dimension of PET slices (pixels).
       RLCTR:    center of the R-L axis of PET slices (pixel
                 number); counting from 1.
       VERTPETDIM:AP dimension of PET slices (pixels).
       RLSLICEDIM:AP dimension of PET slices in xray (cm).
