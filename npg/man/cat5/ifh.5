NAME
     ifh or Interfile Format Header


DESCRIPTION
     This format consists of a self-describing ASCII header  file
     comprised  of  key-value  pairs  plus  a separate image data
     file.

     The header file will  have  the  extension  ".ifh"  and  the
     binary image file will have the extension ".img".  This will
     allow creation of  an  accompanying  ".hdr"  Analyze  header
     which  will allow the image data file to be immediately com-
     patible with Analyze.  The simplicity of the Interfile  for-
     mat  with  a  complete  specification  in an ASCII header is
     designed to allow virtually anyone to read image data into a
     readily interpretable array, unlike most other formats which
     require availability of external  dictionaries,  structures,
     or subroutines.

     1) Row-Major matrix order (1st dimension changes slowest)
     2) Case insensitive text in headers
     3) All text following a semicolon is treated as comments
     4) Order of key-values pairs is unimportant (at least for our applications)
     5) "!" in keywords is treated as white space by our applications.
        However, some outside applications require leading !'s on all keys
        despite the elimination of this requirement in ver 3.3 in 1992;
        notably lagging in this standard is analyze_avw.

     The minimal key values to describe a 3-D data set for our applications:

        INTERFILE :=
        version of keys           :=  3.3
        image modality            :=  mri
        number format             :=  signed integer
        number of bytes per pixel :=  2
        number of dimensions      :=  3
        matrix size [1]           :=  256
        matrix size [2]           :=  256
        matrix size [3]           :=  160
        scaling factor (mm/pixel) [1]  :=  2.0
        scaling factor (mm/pixel) [2]  :=  2.0
        scaling factor (mm/pixel) [3]  :=  2.0
        matrix initial element [1]     :=  superior
        matrix initial element [2]     :=  anterior
        matrix initial element [3]     :=  left

     Outside applications typically will not use multi-dimension
     specifications are require number of slices to be identified:
        number of slices := 160

     also, the byte-order should be specified:

        imagedata byte order   := bigendian

     There does not appear to be any identification of pixel ordering
     in the Interfile standard. Our use of the "matrix initial element"
     keys is unique. With any other software, you must verify the
     orientation.  (E.g., Analyze_avw orients the same image data
     differently when Analyze headers and Interfile headers are used.)


LIST OF KEYS WITH EXAMPLES
     INTERFILE  :=

     version of keys := <Numeric> 3.3

     imaging modality := <ASCII>   [mri | pet]

     originating system := <ASCII>       [ECAT/953 | PETT-VI |
                              ECAT/961 | MAGNETOM-VISION |
                              MAGNETOM-SP]

     number format := <ASCII>    [unsigned integer | float |
                                 signed integer | byte]

     number of bytes per pixel := <Numeric>  [1 | 2 | 4]

     number of dimensions := <Numeric>       [2 | 3]

     matrix size [n] := <Numeric>            [128 | 256]
        First dimension [n] is 1.
        First dimension changes slowest in the image.
        For 3 dimensions (1,2,3) read into an array without
        changing the ordering of the elements, the arrays
        would be declared C_array[1][2][3],
        Fortran_array(3,2,1), or IDL_array(3,2,1).

     scaling factor (mm/pixel) [n] := <Numeric>  [1.0 | 2.0]

     matrix initial element [n] := <ASCII>   [left | right |
                                          anterior | posterior |
                                          superior | inferior]
        matrix initial element is the spatial localization of the
        initial element of the data with respect to the subject.
        This is not part of Interfile 3.3. In our standard space
        left/right = x, anterior/posterior = y, superior/inferior
        = z  (all directions from subject's perspective).

     matrix axis label [n] := <ASCII>        [x | y | z]

     atlas name := <ASCII>                  [Talairach 1988]
        Name of the atlas to which the "atlas origin" key refers.

     atlas origin [n] := <Numeric>

     The Interfile v3.3 specification  may  be  obtained  through
     anonymous    ftp    from    the    host   uwovax.uwo.ca   in
     nucmed/interfile/interfile33.complete

     The Interfile specification is not very complete for MR  and
     PET.   I  found many additional keys with the qsh documenta-
     tion.  In particular, see get  documentation  via  anonymous
     ftp    at    host    nucmed.med.nyu.edu    in    the    file
     pub/qsh/doclib/imformat.ps

     A general listing of image file formats can be found in  the
     Medical  Image  Format  FAQ (which appears in Usenet news in
     alt.image.medical)

     Images converted using img2if or img2nucmed can be  read  by
     NucMed  Image (version 1.62 or later). Analyze_avw will read
     images if initial !'s are added.
