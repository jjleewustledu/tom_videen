NAME
     voi - volume-of-interest file


DESCRIPTION
     A voi file contains a list of  X,  Y,  Z  coordinates  which
     define  the  centers  of  regular  volume-of-interest in PET
     space (in pixels). Coordinate values start with 1 and not 0;
     e.g., for a 128 x 128 slice, the center is (64.5, 64.5).

     Currently, X and Y are in pixels and Z is  a  slice  number.
     The  coordinate (1, 1, 1) is at the left, anterior, superior
     corner of the image volume.

     The file begins with 3 header lines that are followed by the
     list of points.

     _L_i_n_e _1:
         integer string

     where:
         integer = file type (must be 30!)
         string  = PET image type (may be anything)

     _L_i_n_e _2:
         string

     where this may be anything but typically might be:
         string = program that created this file
         real   = version number of that program
         string = user id
         string = short atlas filename used in creating this file
         string = short sxr filename used in creating this file

     _L_i_n_e _3:
         integer

     where:
         integer = number of points in this file

     _L_i_n_e_s _4+:
         string real real real

     where:
         string = name of VOI (single string with no blank spaces)
         reals  = X, Y, Z coordinates in PET pixels of the center of the VOI
          (unlike spideram reg files, this is read in free format)


NOTE
     Given a parameter file and subject list  file,  a  voi  file
     name is constructed by using the following algorithm:

         filename = <species><subject_id><atlfile_root>.voi

     Also, note that the voi file for voistat differs from the voi file created
     and used by vidi.
