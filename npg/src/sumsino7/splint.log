sumsino7.c: (in function main)
sumsino7.c:154:5: Variable matrix is released in true branch, but live in
                     continuation.
  The state of a variable is different depending on which branch is taken. This
  means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage. (Use -branchstate
  to inhibit warning)
