    glucnoflow.f contains all the code for the glucose model 

    (The noflow means the type of model used for PET data.)

     Can be compiled using fortjm glucnoflow ; produces glucnoflow.tsk

     See TESTS for a test case

    I have several versions of this code, but the differences don't appear to be in
    the model. One difference has to do with estimating the SD of the estimates.
    This is the latest version--I don't know what version Bill used last.

    Latex documents : output converted to pdf using ps2pdf are also here.

     nfgluc.tex     ASCII file 
     fdg.tex        ASCII file

 Steps for LATEX

 1)  use a text editor to generate or modify file1.tex (must be ASCII file) 
 2)  latex file1    (will format file1.tex )
 3)  xdvi file1     (will display file1.dvi)
 4)  dvips -o file1.ps file1   (will produce printable .ps file)
 5)  lpr -Ptarzan file1.ps     (print file)
 6)  ps2pdf file1.ps           (convert .ps file to .pdf file)
