@.TH ALIGN_OXYGEN 1 "02-Mar-99" "Neuroimaging Lab"

.SH NAME
align_oxygen - align HO, OO, and CO images

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
align_oxygen pid slices 

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script aligns the OO and CO images of a triple pack to the HO image.

.SH PRE-PROCESSING 
Requires 4 images for the subject (tr1, ho1, oo1, oc1) and metproc hdr files for
the 3 emission images. The images should be filtered (with pixel size corrected
prior to filtering) and the hdr files should have suffixes corresponding
to the specified filter (i.e., p5000ho1_g3.hdr).
In addition to these 7 files, 3 parameter files should be copied from
/usr/local/npg/lib/prm.
The recommended procedure is to create a temporary directory and copy the 4 images,
3 hdr and 3 parameter files to it, and perform all processing there. 

.SH PROCESSING STEPS
.nf
1) Get parameter files, PET images and hdr files.
	mkdir temp
	cd temp
	cp ../p5000tr1.v .
	cp ../p5000ho1.v .
	cp ../p5000oc1.v .
	cp ../p5000oo1.v .
	cp ../p5000ho1_g3.hdr
	cp ../p5000oc1_g3.hdr
	cp ../p5000oo1_g3.hdr
	cp /usr/local/npg/lib/prm/* .

2) You may wish to correct the pixel size of 961 images
   before doing any processing (2.086 -> 2.144 mm).
	setpixsize p5000tr1.v 0.2144
	setpixsize p5000ho1.v 0.2144
	setpixsize p5000oc1.v 0.2144
	setpixsize p5000oo1.v 0.2144

3) Filter images: (gauss 0.3 for emis; gauss2d 0.5 for trans).
	gauss2d p5000tr1.v 0.5
	gauss p5000ho1.v 0.3
	gauss p5000oc1.v 0.3
	gauss p5000oo1.v 0.3

   Note: Images with either too high or too low
   resolution lead to poorer coregistration.
   The 0.3 cutoff works well with our images.
   The gauss2d filter filters in the XY dimension
   only and is used for non-interactive creation
   of the brain mask for the alignment.

4) View the 4 filtered images in spideram, checking
   the quality of the images. Determine the range of
   slices to specify in the align_oxygen script by
   viewing p5000tr1_2dg5.v scaled to max = 1300.

   Top = first slice clearly showing brain (use the
      appearance of the second brown, representing
      values <85% of max or < 1100)

   Bottom = first slice containing sphenoidal sinus
      (use first slice with green behind the eyes).

   Note: The brain mask used during alignment is created
   from p5000ho1_g3.v over slices top-to-bottom scaled
   to common maximum and thresholded at 50%. 
   The vessel mask used to align the CO image is created
   from p5000oc1_g3.v thresholded to 40% of its maximum
   in the slices top-to-(bottom-20). Both masks are
   created automatically in the align_oxygen script.

5) Align the images.

      align_oxygen p5000 3to31

6) Check the log file, p5000_align.log:

   Cost function for alignlinear oo to ho is typically ~0.1.
   For alignlinear oc to oo-ho, it is typically ~0.5.
   The shifts should be 'reasonable' for both alignments.
   The histogram after alignment should have lower SD and 
   fewer outlying values (scale histogram values by 0.001
   to get OEF).
 
7) Use vidi to check alignment in all 3 orientations:
      Image 1 = original HO (rp5000ho1_g3.v)
      Image 2 = aligned OO  (rp5000oo1_g3.v)
         color 1 = inverse gray
         2 over 1
 
      Image 1 = aligned CO (rp5000oc1_g3.v)
      Image 2 = OO_HO  (p5000oo11-ho1_g3.v)
 
8) Use spideram to compare OEF images.
   Create a template at 1% threshold using:
      rbrainmsk.v
   Use this template to view (with common max):
      p5000oef0_g3.v
      rp5000oef1_g3.v
 
9) If there is a second triple to be aligned, skip to 11.
   Create and move processing files to a subdirectory,
   called PET_alignment_processing. The only files in 
   this directory which should definitely be saved are
   the _align.log and .air files. You can remove most
   other files used during processing with:
 
	clean_oxygen p5000

10) At this point, you could clear everything from the temp
   directory with:
	mv * ..
	cd ..
	rmdir temp

11) If there is a second triple to be aligned, leave all files
   from the first set. Align HO2 to HO1, then align the triple
   as above but using the realigned HO as the reference.

.SH REFERENCES
.nf
The realignment uses the algorithms of:
   Woods et al (1992) JCAT 16:620-633. (OC to OO-HO).
   Woods et al (1993) JCAT 17:536-546. (OO to HO).

Requires 4 images for the subject (tr1, ho1, oo1, oc1) and hdr files for
the 3 emission images. The images should be unfiltered (pixel size is corrected
prior to filtering) and the hdr files are assumed to have the suffixes _g3.hdr.
The 7 files can be copied from another directory using 'get_oxygen', which
also copies 3 parameter files used in the processing.
