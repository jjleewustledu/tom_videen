C  Author:       Tom O. Videen
C  Date:         21-May-87
C  Written For:  SPIDERAM Super PETT Image Display Program
C
C  Intent:
C     Erase the midline.
C
C   Note:
C     If the midline is at the border of adjacent columns of PET
C     pixels the line is drawn as a single column of Ramtek pixels
C     covering the first column of the right hand PET pixels.
C     If the midline is one column of PET pixels the line is drawn
C     with the same width as PET pixels and covers the entire column.
C
C  History:
C     Modified by TOV 26-Sep-91 for XSPIDERAM.
C
C  Variable Passed:
C     PLANE = plane in which midline is written;
C
C  Uses:
C     P2MIDLIN
