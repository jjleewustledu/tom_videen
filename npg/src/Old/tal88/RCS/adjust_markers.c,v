/*	========================================================================
 *	Module:				adjust_markers.c
 *	Date:					23-Apr-93
 *	Author:				Tom Videen
 *	Description:	Adjust sxr.magnification_factor and sxr.dz for differences in the 
 *			geometry of the skull xray and variations in the computation of 
 *			sxr.magnification_factor over the years. (PETT VI only)
 *
 *	History:
 *			12-Aug-93	Finally agrees with structure SXR_OUTPUT!
 *
 *	SXR file notes:
 *    type = 1
 *       If the magnification factor is 0.93, then the OLD cassette
 *       holder was used with the slice markers between the head and the
 *       xray source, AND the PET was in the old room with the xray
 *       source closer to the head.  It is further assumed that the
 *       reference slice position for xrays with a single slice marker
 *       (7) was measured using the slice spacing of xrays with 7-slice
 *       markers (and therefore is uncorrected and must be adjusted by
 *       mag_markers).
 *          P < P987
 *          sxr.magnification_factor = 0.93
 *          mag_markers = 0.89
 *
 *    type = 2
 *       If the magnification factor is 0.94, then the OLD cassette
 *       holder was used with the slice markers between the head and the
 *       xray source.
 *          P987 <= P < P1575
 *          sxr.magnification_factor = 0.945
 *          mag_markers = 0.910
 *
 *    type = 3
 *       If the magnification factor is 0.945 and the SXR file does NOT
 *       contain an 'incorrect delta-z' message, then the NEW (1988)
 *       cassette holder was used with the old slice markers between the
 *       head and the xray source.
 *          P1575 < P <= P1611
 *          sxr.magnification_factor = 0.947
 *          mag_markers = 0.913
 *
 *    type = 4 (no changes in values!)
 *       If the magnification factor is 0.945 and the SXR file contains
 *       an 'incorrect delta-z' message, then the NEW (1988) cassette
 *       holder was used with the slice markers against the cassette.
 *          P >= P1575
 *          sxr.magnification_factor is not changed
 *          mag_markers = 1.0 (but is not used)
