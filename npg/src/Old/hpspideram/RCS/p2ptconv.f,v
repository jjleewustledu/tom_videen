C  Subroutine:   P2PTCONV.FTN
C
C  Author:       Tom O. Videen
C  Date:         25-Mar-87
C  Written For:  SPIDERAM Super PET Image Display Program
C
C  Intent:
C     This routine takes the location of a point on the Ramtek
C     Display Monitor screen and converts its location to the
C     corresponding location in the image array in which the
C     point would be included.
C
C     The routine checks that the point is within the boundaries
C     of the image:  if it is not, it returns the point on the
C     closest boundary of the image and positions the cursor
C     at this point and returns CFLAG = TRUE.
C     If the cursor is not repositioned, CFLAG = FALSE.
C
C   The point returned to the calling program will always be a
C     point in image space.
C
C     For coronal/sagittal images Y-values may be just outside
C     the image so that a region may be created which encloses the
C     entire image (i.e., Y=0 is allowed).
C
C  Common Blocks from SPIDERAM.INC:
C     **LUINFO   - logical units (also /USRIO/)   (read only)
C     **DISPLAY  - display parameters             (read only)
C
C  Variables:
C     X,Y = when the subroutine is ENTERED, these are Ramtek
C             coordinates of a point;
C           when RETURNING to the calling program, these are
C             image array coordinates of the point;
C     CFLAG = TRUE if the cursor is reset with a call to SETCUR
C         (this flag is necessary since SETCUR always leaves
C          the TRACK bit of the trackball set to 0, which can
C          wreak havoc in the calling program)
C     XCUR,YCUR = location of the point that is to be returned
C          in Ramtek coordinates;  (used for relocating the
C          cursor if necessary)
C     XTERM = last x-value in Ramtek coordinates;
C     YTERM = last y-value in Ramtek coordinates;
C     YONE    = first y-value in image coordinates;
C     YZERO = first y-value in Ramtek coordinates;
C
C  Uses:
C
C  SPIDERAM.LIB Functions:
C     XINDEX - converts Ramtek x-coordinate to image x-index;
C     YINDEX - converts Ramtek y-coordinate to image y-index;
C     XRAMTEK - converts image x-index to Ramtek x-coordinate;
C     YRAMTEK - converts image y-index to Ramtek y-coordinate;
