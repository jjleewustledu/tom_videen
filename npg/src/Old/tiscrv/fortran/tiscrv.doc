TISCRV.DOC                                        TOV 04-Jun-92~

     This program computes a tissue activity curve using a regions-of-
interest file (.REG) created by SPIDERAM or LOCATES, a file of PET
scan information (.RPO), and PETT VI image files.  The TSC file
created may be used with Joanne Markham's parameter estimation
programs.


 Call the program with:

     TISCRV REGfile, RPOfile, TSCfile

where the files names have no extensions.  I.e.,

     TISCRV M100, M100, M100

The input files must exist.  The output (.TSC) file is created by the
program.


Notes:

1) All PET images readable by Concurrent version of SPIDERAM are
   handled.

2) Only rectangular ROIs may be used.
