Approximate conversion from Talairach 1967 (HD6) to Talairach 1988:

	x(88) = x(67) * 130/145				= 0.9 * x(67)

	y(88) = y(67) * 172/163 - 11	= 1.06 * y(67) - 11 (mm)

	z(88) = z(67) * 75/70					= 1.07 * z(67)


This assumes linear scaling in each of the 3 dimensions, 
which was not how SARP was implemented.
