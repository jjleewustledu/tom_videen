.SH NAME

view25d - Creates PET image figures using atlas outlines, irregular ROIs, and
AF3D points.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B view25d 

.SH DESCRIPTION

Creates colored illustrations using any combination of PET image files, Atlas outlines 
(HD6 transverse sections), Region files (.TRG regions created by RAPTURE), and AF3D 
coordinates.  The PET image files can be in encoded or decoded PETT VI,  SuperPETT I, or 
SuperPETT II file formats.  We can also read any 1-49 slice files (standard, SARPed, 
timage, etc.)

Single slices may be sized, scaled, and positioned anywhere in the window.
Multiple slices may be displayed with any spacing in any direction or angle
and may be stacked partially overlapping adjacent slices.

Colors can be selected for background, atlas, region, AF3D points, and labels for Z-value.
Color scales and color tables for PET images are selectable. 
Custom labels may be created anywhere on the screen with user specified font, size, 
style, and color.

The program operates with pull down menus for all options.
