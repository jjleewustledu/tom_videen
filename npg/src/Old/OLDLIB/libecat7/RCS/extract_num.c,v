	description	extract_num() takes the string pointed to 
			by p and extracts the first integer found in
			the string, sets add to the number of digits
	                in the integer and returns thevalue of the
			integer found.
			
	input		p is a pointer to a string that begins with a
			decimal digit.
	
	output		On exit, extract_num() returns the value of the
			leading integer in the string pointed to by p and
		        sets add to point to the number of the digits in
			the integer.
