@.TH XWD2PS l "10 June 1990"
.SH NAME
xwd2ps \- convert X11 window dumps to PostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xwd2ps [options] [inputfile]
.LP

.SH DESCRIPTION

The program, "xwd2ps", (X Window Dump to PostScript) takes an XWD file
as input and produces a PostScript file that can be printed on a color
PostScript printer.  Unlike many other pixmap to Postscript
converters, xwd2ps creates run-length encoded images to reduce the
size of its output, and hence, transmission time to the printer.

The user can control the size of the image on the printed page (w and
h options) and can has some control over the portion of the file that
is printed (W and H options).  If only one of the dimensions is
selected (i.e., only the -w option is choosen) the other dimension is
picked to retain the correct aspect ratio of the image.  The user can
also add a title string, the time and date and a company logo (s, t, d
and l options).

Xwd2ps produces encapsulated PostScript files from X11 window dump
files.  These files can be read into page layout programs such as TPS
from Interleaf, Framemaker, TeX, etc.  They can be scaled, translated,
rotated, etc., by the composition program.

.SH NOTES FOR THE ADVANCED USER
 
Normally, the PostScript code generated uses the colorimage operator.
Since most other PostScript printers do not (yet) support the
PostScript "colorimage" operator, a PostScript program that emulates
one of the RGB modes of the colorimage operator by producing a gray
scale image is automatically included in the output.

If you specifically want to print a 24 bit color image on a monochrome
printer, you should use the "-m" option to reduce the size of the
output file.  The color information is converted to grayscale
intensity values using the CIE formula:

     intensity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue

(This is also the formula implemented in colorimage.ps described in
the previous paragraph.)

Occasionally, the output produced from xwd2ps cannot be printed on a
monochrome printer even though the -m option was used.  In particular,
is not possible to printer an image of a full screen X11 window dump
file on a 2MB LaserWriter.  With 2MB on an Apple LaserWriter II NTX,
the maximum portion of the screen that can be printed is limited to
about 525000 pixels (any X-Y combination, e.g.  750x700).  At least
3MB is needed in the printer to print the entire screen.  (The program
could be modified to average 4x4 pixel blocks or something similar.)

This problem results from insufficient virtual memory in the printer.
To get around this problem, you can specify some fraction of the x and
y directions of the X11 window dump data.  This is accomplished with
the W and H options.  Positive fractions start from the upper right
corner.  By using negative fractional numbers, it is possible to
specify fractions starting from opposite corners.

For example, for a 1152x900 24-bit X11 window dump image in the file
colordump:

    xwd2ps colordump -w7 -W.445 -H.569 | lpr

will send the upper left 512x512 portion of the screen to the printer.
The image will print with a 7" height (and width in this case.)

As another example,

    xwd2ps colordump -w7 -W -.445 -H .569 > colordump.eps

will create a PostScript file of the upper right 512x512 portion of
the screen.

(INFO: The "note" operator immediately after "gsave" at approximately
line 12 is used to obtain more virtual memory for the image operator.
It slightly restricts the size of the image that can be printed on a
page, but makes additional memory (approximately 100,000 bytes)
available for the image X11 window dump data.  Unfortunately, the note
operator is not recognized by the QMS color printer and the extra code
is required.  The QMS printer has 8MB of memory of which approximately
4.5 Mbytes are available to the user.)

The PostScript files are expected to be smaller than the original X11
window dump files because of the run-length encoding.  On two sample
screen dump files the output PostScript files are 36% and 70% of the
size of the original files, respectively.

On a Sun 3/50, it takes 2.5 to 3.5 minutes to convert the files from
X11 X11 window dump to PostScript.  The program could be tuned,
compiled with optimization and floating point options, or run on
another machine to improve this.

We've found that files that we generate typically take approximately
10 minutes to print.  At 19200 baud, the printer receives
approximately 2400 characters per second.  Thus, a typical file takes
1 to 2 minutes to transfer.  Another minute is required for the four
passes to lay down the colors. Thus, approximately 5-7 minutes is used
for internal processing.

.SH PROGRAM HISTORY

This program evolved mainly from two sources: cras2ps (a Sun color
raster program) and xpr (a program for printing X11 window dumps).
Bob Tatar did the initial port of cras2ps to support X11.  Craig
McGowan extended the work to support eight bit color displays.

The PostScript files produced by this program from 24 bit X11 window
dump input files are runlength encoded using a modified version of the
PostScript code created by Chris Nafis. The two minor modifications by
Bob Tatar made result in a slightly greater efficiency of the
encoding, as well as, a slightly greater (1% to 10%) speed improvement
in the PostScript interpreter.  Craig McGowan modified the PostScript
code to support 8 bit X11 window dump input.

.SH BUGS

.B Encapsulated PostScript 
.LP 
To make use of the Encapsulated PostScript capability, do not
specify the logo option or use input files (-f option) containing
PostScript code.  The "%%BOUNDING BOX" comment does not have
information about the logo size or data from external input files and
therefore these options cannot be used.  If you need to import a file
with a logo, you can edit the %%BOUNDING BOX parameters.

.B Slow Landscape Printing
.LP
It has also been discovered that it takes approximately 3 times longer
to print a file in "landscape" orientation (image horizontal is
parallel to longer direction of paper) instead of "portrait"
orientation (image horizontal is parallel to narrower direction of
paper).  Thus, a full screen dump of 1152 x 900 pixels took 14 minutes
to print in portrait orientation and took 39 minutes in landscape
orientation.  This is probably due to the non-sequential memory
accesses required for landscape orientation.  It is possible to
"rotate" the image in memory before creating the PostScript file, and
this will probably be done at a later date.
