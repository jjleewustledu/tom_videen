mott_plot.c: (in function polar_image)
mott_plot.c:93:38: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses errno,
                      modified by right operand): pow(x, 2.) + pow(y, 2.)
  Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation of function parameters or
  subexpressions is not defined, so if a value is used and modified in
  different places not separated by a sequence point constraining evaluation
  order, then the result of the expression is unspecified. (Use -evalorder to
  inhibit warning)
