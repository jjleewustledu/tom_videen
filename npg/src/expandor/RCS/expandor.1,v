.SH NAME
expandor - set to spec. value all pixels <= min OR >= max
AND which are connected to a pixel with another spec. value

.SH SYNOPSIS
expandor input output oldval newval min max

.SH PARAMETERS
.nf
input  - filename of input image
output - filename of output image
oldval - value to identify previously masked pixels
newval - value to assign to masked pixels
min    - mask below this intensity
max    - mask above this intensity
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads an ANALYZE image and sets the value of all pixels which
have values either <= min OR >= max and which are connected to a pixel
having another specified value. 
All other pixel values will be preserved.

The search for connected pixels is done plane-by-plane without
searching for connected pixels in adjacent planes.

This masked object image is written to the output file 
in ANALYZE format.
