gauss2d.c: (in function main)
gauss2d.c:73:9: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                   snprintf instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
gauss2d.c:157:20: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses errno,
                     modified by right operand): -log(2.0) / pow(f0, 2.0)
  Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation of function parameters or
  subexpressions is not defined, so if a value is used and modified in
  different places not separated by a sequence point constraining evaluation
  order, then the result of the expression is unspecified. (Use -evalorder to
  inhibit warning)
gauss2d.c:157:20: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand modifies
                     errno, used by right operand): -log(2.0) / pow(f0, 2.0)
gauss2d.c:171:25: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses errno,
                     modified by right operand): pow(fx, 2.0) + pow(fy, 2.0)
gauss2d.c:171:25: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand modifies
                     errno, used by right operand): pow(fx, 2.0) + pow(fy, 2.0)
gauss2d.c:177:24: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses errno,
                     modified by right operand): pow(fx, 2.0) + pow(fy, 2.0)
