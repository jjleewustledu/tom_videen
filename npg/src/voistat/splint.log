voistat.c: (in function main)
voistat.c:242:2: Clauses exit with regfile referencing fresh storage in true
                    branch, local storage in false branch
  The state of a variable is different depending on which branch is taken. This
  means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage. (Use -branchstate
  to inhibit warning)
   voistat.c:237:3: Fresh storage regfile created
voistat.c:255:9: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                    snprintf instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
