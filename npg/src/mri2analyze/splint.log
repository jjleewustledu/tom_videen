mri2analyze.c:134:20: Possibly null storage ptr passed as non-null param:
                         strncpy (..., ptr, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   mri2analyze.c:132:8: Storage ptr may become null
