analyze8to16_multiframe.c:102:3: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf. 
                                    Recommend using snprintf instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
analyze8to16_multiframe.c:102:12: Possibly null storage fnum passed as non-null
                                     param: sprintf (fnum, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
