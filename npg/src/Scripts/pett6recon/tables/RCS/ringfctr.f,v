C  Program:      RINGFCTR.FTN
C
C  Author:       Tom O. Videen
C  Date:         31-Aug-88
C  Written For:  PETT VI Image Reconstruction
C
C  History/Revisions:
C     Differs from original RINGFAC file (1981) in that:
C        1) Output file of reals instead of scaled integers;
C        2) 108 values instead of 54 which must be used 54-1,1-54;
C
C  Intent:
C     Compute a scaling factors for the ring activity, which varies with
C     each profile bin.  These values are used in the correction factors
C     in CORSCAN in the reconstruction of emission scans.
C
C  IMPORTANT NOTE: The first set of ring factors are computed
C     in this program.  The second set of factors are read from
C     the old (07-Dec-81) SYS:RINGFAC/200 file. This second set is
C     to be used when the resolution of the transmission and
C     emission scans are different.  The accuracy of this
C     second set of ring factors is unknown to TOV.  It is thought
C     to correspond to measured values, although they were performed
C     on a different ring from the current one.
C
C     Output File: see PETT6RNG.FIL
C
C  Logical Units:
C     1 = New ring factor table (NEWTABLE)
C     2 = Old ring factor table (OLDTABLE)
C     5 = User output (USER)
C
C  Uses Subroutines:
C     SYSIO
