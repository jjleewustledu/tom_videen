@.TH ALIGN_DYNAMIC_MASK "15-Mar-2001" "Neuroimaging Lab"

.SH Name
align_dynamic_mask - align dynamic PET images

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
align_dynamic_mask root ext ref frms blur resample_air
	root = input filename root minus frame number
	ext  = input file extension
	ref  = image to determine pixels in cost function and to
		estimate the mean pixel shift
	frms = frame numbers to align
	blur = filter applied in alignlinear
	resample_air = AIR file used to resample images prior to
		alignlinear

.SH DESCRIPTION
An overview of dynamic image alignment is described in the man page
aligning_dynamic, and you are urged to read that. A number of steps are
typically required before and after align_dynamic_mask which are not described
here. 

The input files to align_dynamic_mask are single-frame Analyze format.
align_dynamic_mask assumes these begin with the letter "a" (local
convention to denote Analyze files) and it assumes that you have given
the root name without the "a".

The reference image is in ECAT format and typically is any image masked to brain.
It's choice does not affect the alignment. The estimated mean voxel shift in X, Y and
Z dimensions are derived from the mean shift of all voxels within the masked volume
in this image.

Blur is applied in all 3 dimensions of each input image frame. The number specifies
the FWHM of the gaussian filter applied in whatever units the Analyze image header
describes the image.

The resample_air file is an AIR file created to resample the input image into a different
pixel size in order to remove bias due to pixelization (see Andersson, 1998, and man
aligning_dynamic for more details). There are several standard resampling files which
have been created (all in /usr/local/npg/air) which have the corresponding inverse
transform to restore the pixel dimensions after reslicing.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
1) dynamic image separated into single-frame images in Analyze format;
.br
2) a reference image (masked, filtered image defining brain) in ECAT format;
.br
3) a rescaling AIR file and its inverse (commonly used ones are in /usr/local/npg/air
and that directory is searched by default);

.SH CREATES
1) combined air files aligning each image to the first frame specified;
.br
2) a null AIR file (used to compute the net pixel shift in each frame);
.br
3) log file showing net movement between each scan and first (using pixels in reference image);
.br
4) log file showing final fit of cost function;

.SH EXAMPLE
align_dynamic_mask p5000fdg i p5000mask.v 3to55 5 scale_961a
align_dynamic_mask p2500mb i p2500mb_mask.img 3to44 5 scale_953
