.SH NAME
decup - remove beam-hardening artifact

.SH SYNOPSIS
decup input output

.SH PARAMETERS
.nf
input   - filename of input image
output  - filename of output image

.SH DESCRIPTION
The intent of this program is to eliminate the beam hardening
effect from CT images of the brain sufficiently to perform semi-automatic
segmentation.

This program reads an ANALYZE image and identifies all pixels within
each slice which are >= 10 and <= 75 (HU). These values are specified in the
shell (transparent to the user) and are intended to restrict the 'normalization'
to brain pixels, reducing the contribution of both CSF and blood clots.

Using these pixels, it computes
the arithmetic center of each slice. It then uses an algorithm introduced
by Mott et al, 1985 (Br J Radiol 58:876) which computes the mean intensity
of radial rings in each slice, where the radius is a proportion of the distance
from the edge to the center. It then computes the difference between this
mean and 35 (HU), which each slice of the image is assumed to have been
normalized to (using slicenrm). For any ring in which this mean difference is
greater than 35, the difference is subtracted from each pixel in the ring.

This masked image is written to the output file 
in ANALYZE format.
