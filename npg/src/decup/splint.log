mott_adjust.c: (in function mott_adjust)
mott_adjust.c:116:38: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses
    errno, modified by right operand): pow(x, 2.) + pow(y, 2.)
  Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation of function parameters or
  subexpressions is not defined, so if a value is used and modified in
  different places not separated by a sequence point constraining evaluation
  order, then the result of the expression is unspecified. (Use -evalorder to
  inhibit warning)
