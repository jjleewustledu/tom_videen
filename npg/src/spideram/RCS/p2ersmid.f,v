C  Intent:
C  .  Erase the midline.
C
C  Note:
C  .  If the midline is at the border of adjacent columns of PET
C  .  pixels the line is drawn as a single column of Ramtek pixels
C  .  covering the first column of the right hand PET pixels.
C  .  If the midline is one column of PET pixels the line is drawn
C  .  with the same width as PET pixels and covers the entire column.
C
C  History:
C  .  Modified by TOV 26-Sep-91 for XSPIDERAM.

C  Variable Passed:
C  .  PLANE = plane in which midline is written;
