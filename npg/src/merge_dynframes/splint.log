  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)

                            another.
  The state of a variable is different depending on which branch is taken. This
  means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage. (Use -branchstate
  to inhibit warning)
