ana2dgauss.c: (in function main)
ana2dgauss.c:145:20: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses
    errno, modified by right operand): -log(2.0) / pow(f0, 2.0)
  Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation of function parameters or
  subexpressions is not defined, so if a value is used and modified in
  different places not separated by a sequence point constraining evaluation
  order, then the result of the expression is unspecified. (Use -evalorder to
  inhibit warning)
