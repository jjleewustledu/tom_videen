@.TH MASKELEVLINES 1 "16-Feb-99" "Neuroimaging Lab"

.SH NAME
maskelevlines - set to specified value any pixel between 2 pixels
whose values are less than oldval1 and oldval2

.SH SYNOPSIS
maskelevlines input output oldval1 oldval2 newval [width] [range]

.SH PARAMETERS
.nf
input   - filename of input image
output  - filename of output image
oldval1 - maximum on one side of line
oldval2 - maximum on other side of line
setval  - value to assign to masked pixels
width   - width of lines to remove
range   - range of slices to mask
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads an ANALYZE image and sets all pixels to a specified value
which are between two pixels whose values are less than oldval1 and oldval2.
All other pixel values will be preserved.

This masked object image is written to the output file 
in ANALYZE format.

The original intent was to mask out elevated (intensity) lines in an
image. Specifically, when the skull is stripped from a CT image, there
remains a line of pixels surrounding brain which has intensities
in the gray matter range but which is due to volume averaging of
the skull and CSF. For some images, a single-pixel line is insufficient
due to the beam-hardening artifact. For these images, mask first with
the default width of 1. Then mask a second time using a width of 2
but restricting this mask to those slices for which it is necessary
(upper half of brain); for lower slices it will remove too much!

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
maskelevlines p5000ct_n p5000seg1_n -2000 20 -2000
maskelevlines p5000ct_n p5000seg1_n -2000 20 -2000 2 1to30
