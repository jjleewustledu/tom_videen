imean.c: (in function main)
imean.c:232:9: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using snprintf
                  instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
imean.c:598:2: Clauses exit with file1->name referencing stack storage in true
                  branch, implicitly only storage in continuation
  The state of a variable is different depending on which branch is taken. This
  means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage. (Use -branchstate
  to inhibit warning)
   imean.c:579:3: Storage file1->name becomes stack-allocated storage
imean.c:598:2: Clauses exit with outfile referencing stack storage in true
                  branch, kept storage in continuation
   imean.c:545:2: Storage outfile becomes kept
   imean.c:579:3: Storage outfile becomes stack-allocated storage
