C  Subroutine:	bldenter.f
C  Author:		Tom O. Videen
C  Date:		27-Oct-86
C  Written for:	BLOOD.FTN
C  Intent:		Get blood curve points from user.
C
C  History:
C     Modified 14-Jan-88 by TOV so decay correction is computed by
C	  including the average decay during the well counting period.
C	  This is now always computed through a single subroutine BLDDECOR.
C			Modified 02-Dec-93 by TOV for betadta.
C
C  Common Variables whose values are set in this subroutine:
C     COUNTS - counts per COUNTIME seconds from well counter;
C     DRYWEIGHT - dry weight of syringe;
C     WETWEIGHT - weight of syringe with blood sample;
C     COUNTIME - seconds summed in well counter (usually 10);
C     TIMEDRAW - time blood sample was taken (MIN.SEC);
C     TIMECNT - time blood sample was counted (MIN.SEC);
C     CORCNTS - decay corrected counts/(ml*sec);
C	  (corrected to time of injection)
C     BLOODDEN = density of blood (g/ml);
C
C  Uses Function:
C     SECS in BLDSECS
