     This program represents a steady-state unit-capillary model of
molecular oxygen transport and utilization.  The user enters a variety
of information specifying the oxygen supply to a unit of tissue and the
oxygen utilization in that tissue.  The tissue is a cylinder with a
cylindrical capillary in its center.  The program computes the oxygen
tension in the tissue along axial and radial dimensions.  The program
output is the computed values.  These may be:

     1) sent to the terminal screen;
     2) sent to a disk file which can be read by PLOT1 or PLOTRAM;
     3) plotted on a GraphOn 230 graphics terminal.

     The values written to the screen may be either the axial or radial
distribution.  Values sent to a file may be any one of the following:

     1) Axial distribution for different radial distances;
     2) Radial distribution for different axial distances;
     3) Whole blood distribution for different axial distances;
     4) Blood plasma distribution for different axial distances;
     5) Oxygen utilization profile for different axial distances;

     Up to 12 different profiles may be plotted on the GraphOn at a
single time (for axial or radial profiles these will be the first 12 if
more than 12 were computed).  The data may be plotted as lines or single
points.  The sizes and types of points and the types of lines may be
selected by the user.  The default scales of the plot are always 0.0 to
1.0 for the abscissa and 0.0 to the maximum value for the ordinate.  The
user may choose the maximum value for the ordinate.

     A legend at the top of the plot contains the name of the plot for
whole blood, plasma or utilization profiles.  For axial profiles it
contains the radial distance at which a given curve was computed, and for
radial distributions it contains the axial distance at which a curve was
computed.

     An oxygen utilization profile may be plotted on the same graph as
any of the other distributions.  It will be normalized to the scale of
the current plot and will not have scale values written for it.

     Up to 5 profiles plus the associated axial or radial distances can
be stored in a disk file.  If more than 5 profiles are computed, the user
can select which 5 will be stored in the file.  Thus, if 10 profiles are
created, the first five may be stored in one file and the second 5 in a
second file so that all 10 may be plotted with PLOT1.  The disk files are
of the 'standard' SPED/SAP/PLOT1/PLOTRAM format.  The first line is a
header of comments entered by the user.  The second line contains the
number of rows (R) and the number of columns (C) in the file.  The rest
of the file contains R rows of C columns of real numbers.

     The program is called by "OPROFILE".  Their are default values for
everything.  The user may easily alter any of the values and recompute
the profiles.

     A graphics cursor may be used to obtain the coordinates of any point
on the graph.  NOTE: there are two graphics cursor locations for every
y-value on the screen--a plotted point may be either one of these. The
y-value written at the bottom of the screen is the MEAN of these two
locations.
