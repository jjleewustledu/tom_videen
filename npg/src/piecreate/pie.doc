CREATION of PIE FILES:

SCAN PIE PHANTOM:

     PET scan must be made of a uniform phantom.  First perform
a normal scan.  Next, fill the phantom with C11-bicarbonate (or
other substance).  Typically, several (4-5) scans are made for
variable lengths of time (attempting to maintain approximately
the same total PET counts per scan) over an hour.  The intent is
to obtain scans with a wide range of bank pairs.  For each scan
record the start time, scan length, and starting bank pairs.
Finally, perform an attenuation scan after the activity in the
phantom has completely decayed.  Reconstruct the phantom images
using the filter(s) for which the conversion factor will be
used.

WELL COUNTS:

     After the last scan several syringes (about 5) are filled
and counted in the well counter.  The PIEDATA program uses
correction factors for the well counter that were derived for 3
cc syringes with blue caps.  Record the syringe dry and wet
weights, the time well counting begins, the counting period
(typically 10 seconds), and the total well counts.


SPIDERAM to create RGT file:

     Use SPIDERAM to display the phantom images and to compute
mean regional activity.  The steps to perform this are:

     1) Enter  SPIDERAM 1  to display on Ramtek #1.

     2) Select "F" for Fast Scan File Entry.  Hit return for HDR
volume (no HDR files will be used).  For default volume, enter
the volume name on which the phantom image files are located
(i.e., TMP1).  The file extension will be either blank (enter
RETURN) or C (if the image files are encoded).  Next enter the
scan file names. Ignore the messages that no HDR file was found;
these are not used. If an image file cannot be found or read, be
sure you have entered the name properly.  When all files have
been entered, enter RETURN to the prompt for a file name (a
blank file name returns the program to the main menu).

     3) Select "D" for Display Options.  Enter "A" and then type
"1" to select the file #1 as the primary scan file for display.
Enter "D" and then "1" to display slice #1 of this image.  Then
return to the main menu by entering "M".

     4) Select "R" for Regions.  Enter "G" to read a new regions
file (REG) from a disk.  Then enter the file name (i.e.,
SYS:PIEHI). You will receive a message that the file has been
read.  (By entering "L", you can see a list of the regions in
this file.) Enter "D" to display one region and select "1", as
this is defined on slice #1.  Now use the numeric key pad to
shift the region around and "E" or "R" to expand or reduce the
region size until the region is located over an appropriate part
of the phantom. Return to the main menu by entering "M".

     5) Display all other regions on the first image file by
alternately going to the Display Options menu (as in step 3) and
to the Regions menu (as in step 4).  You should NOT reread the
regions file, however.  In the regions menu simply display the
region number that matches the current slice number, and then
move the region until it is centered on the phantom.

     6) After all 7 slices have been displayed and all 7 regions
have been displayed and centered, you need to save the current
regions list in a disk file if any of the regions have been
altered. If no regions were moved you need not save the file,
but you should indicate which REG file was used in the header
for the PIE file when you create it.  To save the regions file,
enter the Regions menu and select "F" to file regions list on
disk.  For the file name, enter something like M100PIE (pie file
id followed by PIE--the program automatically adds the extension
.REG).  For the header, enter the name of the pie file, your
initials and the current date, and any other pertinent
information.

     7) Now return to the Display Options menu and select
options to display rows of 7 images, 7 slices at a time.  You
will want to display all of the phantoms to check for
abnormalities in the scans or reconstructions.  You need not
display regions on these images.

     8) You are now ready to create an RGT file.  From the main
menu enter "A" for Analysis of Regions.  A list of the scan
files will appear on the screen with another menu below it.  The
type of processing will appear as PETT numbers.  Select "N" for
number of scan file to process and enter the numbers of all the
scan files. Then enter "A" to process all selected (*) files.
Respond "Y" to the next prompt and then enter the name of the
region file you created earlier (i.e., M100PIE).  The program
will take some time to read in each scan and compute the mean
regional values for all the regions in the list.  Be patient.
When processing is complete, enter "W" to write the output list
to disk (thus saving an RGT file).  Enter the appropriate file
name (i.e., M100PIE--the extension .RGT is automatically added
by the program).  Next enter "P" to print the output list
(printing will not begin until you exit SPIDERAM).  Return to
the main menu and exit the program.  Pick up the printout to
keep with your other PIE data.


PIEDATA:

     This program creates a PDF file (Pie Data File).  Enter
"PIEDATA scan id (i.e., PIEDATA M100B) to call the program. The
program prompts for all input.  For nuclides C11, O15, N13, F18,
and GA68 the program will automatically use default decay
constants based on Lederer & Shirley, Table of Isotopes, 1978
(7th edition) unless you enter a different value when the decay
constant appears. All well counts are decay corrected to a
reference time, which is typically the start time of the first
phantom scan.  Be sure the bank pairs you enter are the starting
bank pairs.  All times must be entered as HH:MM:SS or HH.MM.SS
using 24 hour time and no blank characters (i.e., 09:05:03 and
not 9:5:3 or 9:05:03).

     A PDF file may be modified by running the program again
with the same scan id.  In reprocessing a PDF file, the existing
values will appear as default values for each prompt with one
important exception.  If the nuclide is one of the nuclides for
which a decay constant is stored in the program, the program
decay constant will appear at the default value regardless of
the value in the old PDF file.  To add a scan file or well count
to an existing PDF file, simply change the number of scans (or
well counts) when the prompt appears.  Similarly, to delete a
scan file or well count, change the number of scan or well
counts.  The corrected counts/sec/ml are always recomputed
whenever a PDF file is reprocessed.

     See PDFORMAT.FIL for a description of the contents of the
PDF file.

     The only computation performed within PIEDATA is to compute
the decay-corrected counts/sec/ml for the well counts.  The
formula to compute this is:

  corrected CPS/ml =
      counts*exp(alpha*time) / (period*weight*(sc1+sc2*weight))

  counts = total well counts
  alpha  = decay constant (1/sec)
  time   = reference time - count time (sec)
  period = well counting period  (sec)
  weight = wet weight - dry weight  (g)
  sc1 = 1.026    (corrects for position of sample in counter)
  sc2 = -0.0522  (corrects for weight of sample in well counter)

Assumptions:

1) Negligible decay occurred while the sample was counted.
2) Density of the fluid in the phantom was 1.0 gm/ml.
3) 3 cc syringes with blue or beige caps were used in the well
   counter.  If TB syringes are used, sc1 and sc2 are different.


PIECREAT:

     This program uses the information in the RGT file and PDF
file to create a new PIE file.  To call the program enter:
"PIECREAT PDFfile,RGTfile,PIEfile" (with no file extensions).
The program runs automatically, reading the specified PDF and
RGT files and creating the PIE file.  It will not erase or
rewrite an existing PIE file.  If you enter a PIE file that
exists, the program will stop.  If you want to alter the PIE
file, you will have to delete it yourself.

     The program will ask you for the name of a single file used
to generate the RGT file.  This should be an emission image of
the phantom.  The program will read the header of this file and
use its file type to assign a file type to the pie file.  If the
image was reconstructed with the old reconstruction stream, its
file type will be 1000.  If the image was reconstructed with the
new reconstruction stream, its file type will be 1020.  Any
other file type will generate an error message and prompt for a
different file name. Pies created with the old stream will have
a pie file type of 3; pies created with the new stream will have
a pie file type of 5. Pie file type 4 is reserved for files
which combine the information in both 3 and 5.

     Pie files with type 5 (new reconstruction) will have the
scan date and mean NORM counts/bin/minute written as the last
line of the pie file.  Hence, the NORM time and NORM average are
read from the image file when its type is 1020.  Image files
reconstructed with the new stream prior to 8-Mar-89 only have
these values in the attenuation image file; after this data,
any of the image files may be read.  The program will indicate
if the NORM time and average cannot be read from the header and
ask for an attenuation image.

     See PIEFORM.FIL for a description of the contents of the
PIE file.

     The program computes a weighted-average of bank pairs
during the scan given the starting bank pairs using the
following formula:

  average bank pair =
      0.5*bankpair*(1-exp(-2*alpha*time) / (1-exp(-alpha*time))

  bankpair = starting bank pair
  alpha = decay constant (1/sec)
  time  = length of scan (sec)

     The program computes mean PET counts/pixel by taking the
mean of the regional values for all 7 slices (i.e., the values
in the RGT file).  The mean counts are decay-corrected to the
reference time using the following formulae:

a) decay correct mean PET counts/(pixel*sec) in each scan to
scan start:

     PET1 = meancnts*alpha/(1-exp(-alpha*time))

     meancnts = mean PET counts/pixel/scan from RGT file
     alpha = decay constant (1/sec)
     time  = length of scan (sec)

b) convert to mean PET counts/(pixel*minute):

     PET2 = 60*PET1

c) decay correct PET counts in each scan to reference time:

     PET3 = PET2*exp(alpha*time))

     time  = reference time - count time (sec)

     The conversion factor (pieslope) written to the PIE file is
computed by first computing the mean decay-corrected well counts
by taking the mean of the values in the PDF file.  This value is
then divided by the decay-corrected PET counts.

     PETTCONV = wellcnts/PET3

     wellcnts = mean well counts/sec/ml decay-corrected to
                reference time

     PET3 = mean PET counts/sec/pixel decay-corrected to
                reference time

     PETTCONV has units of: (well counts*pixel)/(PET counts*ml)
