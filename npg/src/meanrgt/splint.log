meanrgt.c: (in function main)
meanrgt.c:97:2: Clauses exit with num referencing local storage in for body,
                   fresh storage if for loop body does not execute
  The state of a variable is different depending on which branch is taken. This
  means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage. (Use -branchstate
  to inhibit warning)
   meanrgt.c:86:2: Fresh storage num created
   meanrgt.c:86:2: Storage num created
meanrgt.c:151:7: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                    snprintf instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
