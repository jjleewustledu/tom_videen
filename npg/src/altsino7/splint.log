altsino7.c: (in function main)
altsino7.c:101:5: Variable matrix is released in true branch, but live in
                     continuation.
  The state of a variable is different depending on which branch is taken. This
  means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage. (Use -branchstate
  to inhibit warning)

   altsino7.c:101:11: Storage matrix released
   altsino7.c:101:5: in continuation:
