dcmpet2img.c:133:9: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                       snprintf instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
dcmpet2img.c:166:18: Possibly null storage command passed as non-null param:
                        strncpy (command, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
