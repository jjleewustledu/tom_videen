.SH NAME
maskimg - mask one image using another

.SH SYNOPSIS

maskimg input mask output threshold

.SH PARAMETERS

.nf
input     - filename of image to be masked
mask      - filename of the mask image (may be same as input)
output    - filename of output image
threshold - minimum pixel value to include
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads 2 PET images and creates an output image
in which every pixel is equal to that of the input image if
it is greater than or equal to the specified threshold in
the mask image and zero if not.  0.0001 is subtracted from
the specified threshold to eliminate potential roundoff errors
for real numbers.

The output image file will have the same format as the input file
(e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
