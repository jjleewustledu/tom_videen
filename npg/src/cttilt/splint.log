cttilt.c:170:13: Possibly null storage pstr_anal passed as non-null param:
                    fread (pstr_anal, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
