dcon1.c: (in function dcon1)
dcon1.c:66:69: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses errno,
    modified by right operand): y0 + kdx * dy / 12. + pow(kdx, 2.) * y0 / 24. +
    pow(kdx, 3.) * dy / 480.
  Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation of function parameters or
  subexpressions is not defined, so if a value is used and modified in
  different places not separated by a sequence point constraining evaluation
  order, then the result of the expression is unspecified. (Use -evalorder to
  inhibit warning)
