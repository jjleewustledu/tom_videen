decay.c: (in function main)
decay.c:60:33: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses errno,
    modified by right operand): a0 * exp(-lambda * t1) * (1. - exp(-lambda *
    len))
  Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation of function parameters or
  subexpressions is not defined, so if a value is used and modified in
  different places not separated by a sequence point constraining evaluation
  order, then the result of the expression is unspecified. (Use -evalorder to
  inhibit warning)
