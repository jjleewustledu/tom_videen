focus2if.c: (in function main)
focus2if.c:202:3: Variable ptr is dependent in continuation, but independent in
                     true branch.
  The state of a variable is different depending on which branch is taken. This
  means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage. (Use -branchstate
  to inhibit warning)
   focus2if.c:202:3: in continuation:
   focus2if.c:103:2: Storage ptr becomes dependent
   focus2if.c:202:3: in true branch:
   focus2if.c:145:4: Storage ptr becomes stack-allocated storage
focus2if.c:202:3: Clauses exit with program_date referencing stack storage in
                     true branch, owned storage in continuation
   focus2if.c:103:2: Storage program_date becomes owned (through alias ptr)
   focus2if.c:145:4: Storage program_date becomes stack-allocated storage
