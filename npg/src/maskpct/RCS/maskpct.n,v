@.TH MASKPCT N "23-May-96" "Neuroimaging Lab"

.SH NAME
maskpct - create a mask image (with pixels = 0 or 1)

.SH SYNOPSIS

maskpct input output threshold [planes]

.SH PARAMETERS

.nf
input     - filename of image to be masked
output    - filename of output image
threshold - percent of maximum pixel count
planes    - range of slices to search for maximum
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads any PET image, searches for the maximum pixel value
(using the range of slices specified or all slices if not), and then
creates a template of the input image including all pixels within
the boundary of pixels >= the percent threshold times the maximum.
This templated image is written to the output file with all pixels
having values of 0 or 1.

The output image file will have the same format as the input file
(e.g., PETT VI or ECAT versions 6 or 7).
