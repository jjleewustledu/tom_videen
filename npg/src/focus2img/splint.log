focus2img.c: (in function main)
focus2img.c:133:9: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                      snprintf instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
focus2img.c:535:17: Possibly null storage simg passed as non-null param:
                       fread (simg, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   focus2img.c:532:11: Storage simg may become null
focus2img.c:559:17: Possibly null storage simg passed as non-null param:
                       fread (simg, ...)
   focus2img.c:556:11: Storage simg may become null
focus2img.c:606:8: Dead storage simg passed as out parameter to free: simg
  Memory is used after it has been released (either by passing as an only param
  or assigning to an only global). (Use -usereleased to inhibit warning)
   focus2img.c:394:9: Storage simg released
