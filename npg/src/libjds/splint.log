get_sspct_head.c:94:17: Variable head_fields shadows outer declaration
  An outer declaration is shadowed by the local declaration. (Use -shadow to
  inhibit warning)

get_sspct_head.c:180:10: Possibly null storage sspct_hdr passed as non-null
                            param: memset (sspct_hdr, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
get_sspct_head.c:200:2: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                           snprintf instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
get_sspct_head.c:211:22: Possibly null storage ptr passed as non-null param:
                            strncpy (..., ptr, ...)
   get_sspct_head.c:209:8: Storage ptr may become null
get_sspct_head.c:216:22: Possibly null storage ptr passed as non-null param:

   get_sspct_head.c:214:8: Storage ptr may become null
get_sspct_head.c:241:10: Operand of ! is non-boolean (int):
                            !strcmp(string, "Topogram")
  The operand of a boolean operator is not a boolean. Use +ptrnegate to allow !
  to be used on pointers. (Use -boolops to inhibit warning)
get_sspct_head.c:287:5: Return value (type size_t) ignored: strftime(sspct_h...
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalother to inhibit warning)

get_sspct_head.c:435:49: Unrecognized identifier: M_PI
  Identifier used in code has not been declared. (Use -unrecog to inhibit
  warning)
get_sspct_head.c:445:11: Possibly null storage anal_hdr passed as non-null
                            param: memset (anal_hdr, ...)

                            fprintf (fp_ifh, ...)
get_sspct_head.c:522:2: Fresh storage string not released before return
  A memory leak has been detected. Storage allocated locally is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreefresh to inhibit
  warning)
   get_sspct_head.c:410:4: Fresh storage string created
dec2sun_float.c:51:46: Function parameter b declared as manifest array (size
                          constant is meaningless)
  A formal parameter is declared as an array with size.  The size of the array
  is ignored in this context, since the array formal parameter is treated as a
  pointer. (Use -fixedformalarray to inhibit warning)
get_bin_str.c: (in function get_bin_str)
get_bin_str.c:50:12: Unqualified static storage tmpstr returned as implicitly
                        only: tmpstr
  Static storage is transferred in an inconsistent way. (Use -statictrans to
  inhibit warning)
