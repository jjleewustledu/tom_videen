.SH NAME
newairpix - changes pixel sizes in an air file

.SH SYNOPSIS
newairpix fname std_size res_size

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program changes the values of the pixel sizes for the
standard and reslice images in an air file.
Some of our realignment procedures use a resampling matrix
(stored in an air file) which was created from a standard image.
Due to slight differences in reconstruction programs, image
pixel sizes occasionally differ by small amounts (< 1%).
However, AIR will not reslice an image if pixel sizes differ.

Since the resampling matrices can be used regardless of these
small differences, newairpix was created to change the values
in the AIR file to circumvent this prohibition.
