	I	modified	the	fdopa	program	so	you	can	use	the	same	steps
	as	for	the	dvr	program.									

1	First	put	the	names	of	the	.dat	files	in	an	input	file	as	shown
	below	for	m1050.											

../m1050_FD_occipital.dat														
../m1050_FD_left_striatum.dat														
../m1050_FD_right_striatum.dat														

2	Then	run	jobtac	which	should	have	the	following	command					

/home/usr/joanne/TEMP/JOELP/gentac.tsk	<gin	>m1050_FD.tac												

	where	gin	is	the	file	containing	the	.dat	files	names.				

	This	will	generate	a	single	tissue-activity	file.							


3	Then	create	the	input	file	(fin)	for	the	fdopa	program	as	shown		

24	94													
m1050_FD.tac														

4	"Finally,"	run	jobf	or	the	following	command							

/home/usr/joanne/TEMP/JOELP/fdopaeiv.new.tsk	<fin	>&out1												


5	Results	are	in	m1050xx.fit	(Ki	values)								
	Data	points	for	linear	regression	are	in	xxx.xyplots	file.					

	Need	to	check	the	COV	and	R	values	for	fdopa	as	noise	can	cause
	problems.	If	COV	is	>	"100%,"	the	Ki	value	is	not	significantly	different		
	from	0	and	I	have	been	putting	0*	in	the	Excel	spreadsheet.			

	Example	files	in												

	/data/petsun7/monkey3/focus_220/m1050/noscatter/FDOPA/ANALYSIS/DUMMY														

	(You	will	need	to	correct	the	path	for	the	.dat	files	in	gin	file	there)

	Let	me	know	if	you	have	any	problems.							

	NOTE:	this	version	of	the	FDOPA	program	doesn't	check	to	be	sure	there	are	
	no	missing	scans	so	it	WILL	NOT	give	correct	results	if	intermediate			
	scans	are	missing.	We	will	have	to	add	that	in	the	MATLAB	version.
