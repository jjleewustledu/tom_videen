alignlst.c: (in function main)
alignlst.c:135:11: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                      snprintf instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
alignlst.c:135:20: Possibly null storage dtype passed as non-null param:
                      sprintf (dtype, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   alignlst.c:90:10: Storage dtype may become null
alignlst.c:139:60: Possibly null storage stdname[0] passed as non-null param:
                      fprintf (..., stdname[0], ...)
   alignlst.c:89:15: Storage stdname[0] may become null
alignlst.c:142:19: Possibly null storage astdpath passed as non-null param:
                      strcpy (astdpath, ...)
   alignlst.c:93:13: Storage astdpath may become null
alignlst.c:154:9: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                     snprintf instead: sprintf
alignlst.c:154:57: Possibly null storage astdpath passed as non-null param:
                      sprintf (..., astdpath, ...)
   alignlst.c:93:13: Storage astdpath may become null

alignlst.c:187:11: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                      snprintf instead: sprintf

                      snprintf instead: sprintf
alignlst.c:210:8: Only storage stdname[0] (type char *) derived from released
                     storage is not released (memory leak): stdname
  A storage leak due to incomplete deallocation of a structure or deep pointer
  is suspected. Unshared storage that is reachable from a reference that is
  being deallocated has not yet been deallocated. Splint assumes when an object
  is passed as an out only void pointer that the outer object will be
  deallocated, but the inner objects will not. (Use -compdestroy to inhibit
  warning)
alignlst.c:30:7: Parameter argc not used
  A function parameter is not used in the body of the function. If the argument
  is needed for type compatibility or future plans, use /*@unused@*/ in the
  argument declaration. (Use -paramuse to inhibit warning)
