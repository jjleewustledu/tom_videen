makehdr.c:104:3: Variable line is dependent in false branch, but independent in
                    true branch.

  means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage. (Use -branchstate
  to inhibit warning)
   makehdr.c:104:3: in false branch:
   makehdr.c:100:4: Storage line becomes dependent
   makehdr.c:104:3: in true branch:
