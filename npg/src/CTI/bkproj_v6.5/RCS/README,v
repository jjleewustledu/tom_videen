Subject: sun bkproj sources
 
Tom:
        You can get bkproj_v6.5.tar.Z from the /tmp directory of the anonymous
ftp account on positron.cti-pet.com. These sources are different from what you
were using before but the results (images) should be very close to what you
get from the ACS reconstruction. Let me know if you have any problems using it.
 
 
Rishi.
