-----
Procedure 2: too many parameters

Procedure 3: correct parameters
-----
1. Run ima_reorder, specifying first and last file numbers

   00045.ima, specify 00002.ima through 00044.ima):
   ima_reorder <firstfile> <lastfile>

Expected results:
1. Same number of files should be present as were present before.
2. Files not specified should not be renamed.
