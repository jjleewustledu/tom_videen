regcoss.c:62:9: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf.  Recommend using
                   snprintf instead: sprintf
  Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to
  inhibit warning)
regcoss.c:95:16: Only storage rgtlist.fname (type char *) derived from variable
                    declared in this scope is not released (memory leak)
  A storage leak due to incomplete deallocation of a structure or deep pointer
  is suspected. Unshared storage that is reachable from a reference that is
  being deallocated has not yet been deallocated. Splint assumes when an object
  is passed as an out only void pointer that the outer object will be
  deallocated, but the inner objects will not. (Use -compdestroy to inhibit
  warning)

average.c:133:81: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses dsqrarg,

  Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation of function parameters or
  subexpressions is not defined, so if a value is used and modified in
  different places not separated by a sequence point constraining evaluation
  order, then the result of the expression is unspecified. (Use -evalorder to
  inhibit warning)
