To recompile, execute the install script.  You may have to edit the
make-files depending on which compiler and operating system you use.
The make-files and compile-scripts were written for SunOS 4.1.3 (with
the gnu-compiler) and for Solaris (with cc).

For the ./idl/mod/Makefile, see the IDL documentation on the
call_external function.

The commands in the file ./idl/startup.pro should be executed at the
beginning of the IDL session. The common variable NC_recon should be
set to the full name of the sharable object file in ./idl/lib.

The C-program is compiled and linked by executing the script
mlempetv7.solaris.  The program requires the UCL-matrix package for
reading and writing CTI-Siemens PET-files (included in the tar-file).


MLEMPETV7
=========
The actual reconstruction program is ./bin/mlempetv7_solaris. It is a static
executable, so it should run immediately on a Sun.

It reconstructs sinograms from version 6 or version 7.0. of the
CTI/Siemens software. At our site, the software runs Solaris 5.6, and
accepts data from an ECAT 931 and from an ECAT 962 (HR+).

For the file I/O, the matrix-software from M. Sibomana, UCL, Belgium
was used. For reading and expanding a normalization, a program written
by C. Michel, UCL, Belgium was changed into a function which is called
by the reconstruction program. This code reads the normalization data
from a single plane and unfolds it into a sinogram-format.

The ML program reconstructs a single sinogram into a single plane. It
only supports 2D reconstruction, it will only read segment 0 from a 3D
sinogram.

For version 6, the result is stored as a subheader-image combination
into a matrix-file. Pixels are in words (16 bit), with must be scaled
by the scalefactor in the subheader.

For version 7.0. the result is stored as a floating point image
into a Pet Volume file. If the volume does not exist, an empty volume
is created and the slice is inserted in the appropriate location.

Float volumes are not really supported by CTI, although the viewing
software accepts the images. We chose to store in a float file,
because CTI does not provide a scalefactor for every slice. Instead,
there is a single scalefactor in the single subheader for all the
slices in that volume (63 in the HR+). An appropriate scalefactor
cannot be computed until all slices have been reconstructed.

There are two additional programs which allow easy conversion from a
float volume into a (globally scaled) word volume. The program
get_minmaxv7 looks for the minimum and or the maximum in a particular
slice, the program copy_imagev7 copies slices from one data type into
the other, if the global scale factor is known.

Use the -h option to see the syntax.

MLEMPETV7.COM
=============
This csh-script reconstructs an entire study. For version 6, it simply
calls mlempetv7 as often as needed. For version 7.0, it produces a set
of float files, one per plane, until an entire volume is
processed. Then it searches for the global minimum and maximum,
computes the scalefactor for the volume, converts all files into the
final word volume file and deletes the float files. Then it optionally
applies a 3D Gaussian smoothing mask to each volume.

To make the script work, you should set the variable proc_dir to
the absolute path, where the software is installed. The current
relative definition only works if you are in the directory "scripts".

Use the -h option to see the syntax.

ITERATION SCHEME
================
For attenuation corrected studies, we apply (both on Ecat931 and HR+)
the scheme 1x16, 1x12, 1x4, 2x1, which is equivalent to 34 full MLEM
iterations. Decreasing the number of subsets is applied to avoid
excessive noise propagation that we have observed when using subsets
all the time.

When the ls option is activated, we use the scheme 3x8m 2x4, 2x1,
because we found that using many subsets with negative values active
sometimes slows down convergence.

The script mlempetv7.com allows 3D Gaussian post-smoothing. We
currently apply the equivalent of about 80 iterations (accelerated
with OS), followed by a post-smooth of FWHM of 0.6 cm. We sum two
adjecent detectors to speed up calculations.  The corresponding
command for a non-attenuation corrected WB study would be:
mlempetv7.com -s filename.S -o filename.v -n filename.n \
   -i 3 -j 8 -i 2 -j 4 -i 2 -j 1 \
   -p 1-63 -b 0-6 -z 1.1 -X 128 -V 70 -R 42.2 -fx 0.6 -sumd 2 -v

Using fewer iterations with more subsets results in much faster
reconstruction, at the cost of slightly increased noise levels.


INSTALLATION
============
The program has been succesfully installed in several sites, so
it is definitely possible. If you have any problems, don't hesitate
to mail me.
The executable mlempetv7 (found under bin) is linked static and should
run immediately, under Solaris. Full installation of the software is
only required if you want to change something or port it to another
platform.

MAPPETTRANS
===========
Maximum-a-posteriori reconstruction of transmission scan, with
computation of attenuation correction factors. Allows correction
for emission contamination in post-injection transmission scans.

See scripts/mappettrans.help

MAPPETTRANS.COM
===============
Script to use process a complete study in a single line.

NOTE
====
The reconstruction software reconstructs separate bed positions,
and does not provide assembling the result in a single volume. You
should use the CTI software for that.
