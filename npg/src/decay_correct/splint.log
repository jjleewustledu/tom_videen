decay_correct.c: (in function main)
decay_correct.c:29:32: Expression has undefined behavior (left operand uses
    errno, modified by right operand): exp(-lambda * (t1 - t0)) * (1. -
    exp(-lambda * len))
  Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation of function parameters or
  subexpressions is not defined, so if a value is used and modified in
  different places not separated by a sequence point constraining evaluation
  order, then the result of the expression is unspecified. (Use -evalorder to
  inhibit warning)
