Rotation will be done to align a line passing through the superior edge of
the anterior commissure and the inferior edge of the posterior commissure.
One plane will pass through this line and the midline of the cerebral
hemispheres.  A second will pass through this line perpendicular to 
the first plane.   The origin will be the x,y,z coordinates of the
superior-posterior edge of the anterior commissure.

X- and y-scaling will use measurements of brain extent in the AC-PC plane
(i.e., the dimensions of the rectangular box bounding the brain on this slice)
even should a larger brain dimension appear in another transvere plane.

Z-scaling will use the maximum distance from the AC-PC plane to
the top of the brain through a coronal section perpendicular to the
AC-PC plane.  This section will typically not pass through the origin.
