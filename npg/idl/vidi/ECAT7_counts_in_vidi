ECAT ver 7 pixel counts in VIDI:
-------------------------------

vidi -> getframe -> getecat7 -> 
	dynimage_read -> rdimg -> rdimg7 -> fread (simg)

raw data (short) is converted to floating point with a scaler:
	img = scaler * simg

Non-quantitative images are identified by any of the following:
	mh7->calibration_factor == 1 
	sh7->filter_scatter_fraction == 0
	sh7->filter_scatter_slope == 0
	sh7->processing_code & 64  == 0
	sh7->processing_code & 128 == 0
and use:
	scaler = REV7NSCALE * mh7->calibration_factor * sh7->scale_factor *
			sh7->frame_duration / sh7->decay_corr_fctr;

Quantitative images use:
	scaler = REV7SCALER * mh7->calibration_factor * sh7->scale_factor *
			sh7->frame_duration / sh7->decay_corr_fctr;

Attenuation images are identified by any of the following:
	sh7->frame_duration == 0
    strncmp (mh7->data_units, "1/cm", 4) == 0
and use:
	scaler = ATNSCALER * sh7->scale_factor;


REV7SCALER	= 0.000001
REV7NSCALE	= 20.
ATNSCALER	= 10000.

Note:
	vidi and other inhouse apps show images without decay-correction by default;
	CTI apps (such as ROI) show image with decay-correction applied;
