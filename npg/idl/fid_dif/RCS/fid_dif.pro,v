; NAME:
;   FID_DIF
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Compare vector distances between 6 points listed in 2 input files.
;
; CATEGORY:
;   Curve fitting.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;   FID_DIF
;
; INPUTS:
;   File1:  Input file containing 3 x 6 array of coordiates
;   File2:  Input file containing 3 x 6 array of coordiates
;
; OUTPUTS:
;   Listing of x, y, and z differences plus total vector distance between points.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;   FID_DIF   (to read "mr.fid", "pet.fid" )
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
